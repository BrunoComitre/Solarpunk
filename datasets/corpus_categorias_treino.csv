1,"If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble .",adventure

3,His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing .,adventure

13,It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up .,adventure
14,"No one walked in this country , least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew .",adventure

59,"Could you give us a job , Mr. ''",adventure
60,`` Morgan .,adventure
61,"He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple .",adventure
62,"They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house .",adventure
63,The girl's thin face haunted him .,adventure
64,It wasn't the face of a killer .,adventure
65,He wasn't so sure about the boy .,adventure
66,"He hadn't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression .",adventure
67,There was more to this than Jones had told him .,adventure
68,They were running from something .,adventure
69,"He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either .",adventure

75,`` Right now you need a meal and a bath .,adventure
76,Your wife's in terrible shape '' .,adventure

101,The girl cried .,adventure
102,"`` Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw '' .",adventure
103,He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much .,adventure
104,"When they were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work '' .",adventure
105,The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself .,adventure
106,"When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on .",adventure
107,"She said , `` I guess the Lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents '' .",adventure
108,Morgan laughed .,adventure
109,`` Which are you '' ? ?,adventure
110,He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall .,adventure
111,"Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones .",adventure
112,"`` No , she'll be all right '' , Jones said quickly .",adventure
113,"`` I mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' .",adventure
114,"`` We'll see '' , Morgan said .",adventure
115,`` Could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ?,adventure
116,The girl asked .,adventure

118,`` That's my spare bedroom .,adventure
119,"The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' .",adventure
120,`` We'll pay you back if you'll let us .,adventure
121,"`` It's all right '' , he said .",adventure
122,`` I get up early .,adventure
123,You'd better sleep '' .,adventure
124,"Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him .",adventure
125,"He said : `` If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch .",adventure
126,We haven't slept together since we started .,adventure
127,"I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ''",adventure
128,"He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' .",adventure
129,`` We had to do something '' .,adventure
130,"They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .",adventure
131,Gavin paused wearily .,adventure
132,`` You can't stay here with me .,adventure
133,It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .,adventure
134,`` You can't make me go '' .,adventure
135,Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .,adventure
136,"He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide .",adventure
137,It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .,adventure
138,"Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .",adventure
139,Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .,adventure
140,Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;,adventure
141,against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .,adventure
142,Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .,adventure
143,He whispered .,adventure
144,"Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .",adventure
145,"It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so .",adventure
146,I believed him .,adventure
147,"They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago .",adventure
148,Just cleared out .,adventure
149,"I didn't understand why , Clay .",adventure
150,They just all cleared out .,adventure
151,I treated them fair '',adventure
152,"He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .",adventure
153,"`` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin '' ? ?",adventure
154,`` Yes '' .,adventure
155,`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?,adventure
156,"Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' .",adventure
157,`` Come here '' .,adventure
158,The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .,adventure
159,Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .,adventure
160,"`` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried .",adventure
161,I tried .,adventure
162,I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .,adventure
163,And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give .,adventure
164,Now there's nothin left of me .,adventure
165,Oh ! !,adventure
166,That would mock me too much ! !,adventure
167,"Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .",adventure
168,"`` I'll go , Clay '' .",adventure
169,Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .,adventure
170,The eyes followed him fearfully .,adventure
171,There isn't much time .,adventure
172,I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .,adventure
173,You get ready '',adventure
174,He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .,adventure
175,"Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .",adventure
176,When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .,adventure
177,Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .,adventure
178,The mare had backed away .,adventure
179,"`` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered .",adventure
180,`` She doesn't want you now .,adventure
181,"You take it easy , your time will come '' .",adventure
182,"Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .",adventure
183,"He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .",adventure
184,Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .,adventure
185,"`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?",adventure
186,There's someone there I have to see .,adventure
187,"I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;",adventure
188,I have to think about it .,adventure
189,But California is where we're goin '' .,adventure
190,Gavin began to nod .,adventure
191,`` That's a new land .,adventure
192,A man could make a mark there .,adventure
193,"Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' .",adventure
194,"`` Yes , like a father and son '' .",adventure
195,"`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .",adventure
196,I made you a man '' .,adventure
197,"`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .",adventure
198,"`` Help me up , Clay .",adventure
199,"Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' .",adventure
200,"Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .",adventure
201,"`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said .",adventure
202,`` They'll trample it down .,adventure
203,I loved my garden '' .,adventure
204,`` It will grow again -- in California '' .,adventure
205,"`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .",adventure
206,"`` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came .",adventure
207,Lived alone by the river .,adventure
208,"It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet .",adventure
209,There was no one but me .,adventure
210,I don't want to leave it '' .,adventure
211,Thirty-five,adventure
212,Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .,adventure
213,"The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .",adventure
214,Gavin sighed bitterly .,adventure
215,In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .,adventure
216,"He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .",adventure
217,"In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .",adventure
218,"The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .",adventure
219,They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .,adventure
220,Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .,adventure
221,"A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .",adventure
222,The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .,adventure
223,"They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .",adventure
224,"The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .",adventure
225,"The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy .",adventure
226,But the liquor had flushed their courage .,adventure
227,"Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .",adventure
228,`` He's leavin .,adventure
229,"That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?",adventure
230,"Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley .",adventure
231,You can't '' --,adventure
232,"`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled .",adventure
233,"`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son .",adventure
234,"You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' .",adventure
235,First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .,adventure
236,Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .,adventure
237,His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy .,adventure
238,He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .,adventure
239,He treats her like she was dirt .,adventure
240,And you stand by like a fool and let him do it '',adventure
241,He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .,adventure
242,It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .,adventure
243,"`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said .",adventure
244,He turned to Lester .,adventure
245,`` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .,adventure
246,He meant to help Gavin all the time .,adventure
247,"He made a fool of you , Lester '' .",adventure
248,He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !,adventure
249,There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .,adventure
250,"If we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back .",adventure
251,There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap -- if we ride hard we can take them '' .,adventure
252,The boy jerked away .,adventure
253,`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?,adventure
254,Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .,adventure
255,They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .,adventure
256,"in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .",adventure
257,"The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .",adventure
258,The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .,adventure
259,He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .,adventure
260,He rode low on the mare's neck .,adventure
261,"Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away .",adventure
262,he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .,adventure
263,"He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .",adventure
264,"And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time .",adventure
265,The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .,adventure
266,"With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .",adventure
267,The Gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him .,adventure
268,"California is too far , he thought .",adventure
269,He would never reach California .,adventure
270,"He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .",adventure
271,The sentry was not dead .,adventure
272,"He was , in fact , showing signs of reviving .",adventure
273,He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol .,adventure
274,A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .,adventure
275,He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .,adventure
276,Mike stripped these from him and donned them .,adventure
277,"He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .",adventure
278,They dragged him inside the building .,adventure
279,"Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet .",adventure
280,`` You are hurt '' ! !,adventure
281,She breathed .,adventure
282,He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek .,adventure
283,`` You are very brave '' .,adventure
284,Mike silenced them .,adventure
285,`` We'll talk later .,adventure
286,"First , we've got to get out of here '' .",adventure
287,"`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said .",adventure
288,"`` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' .",adventure
289,But it at least offered him a chance for living .,adventure
290,He had none here .,adventure
291,The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .,adventure
292,Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .,adventure
293,No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .,adventure
294,"About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight .",adventure
295,He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .,adventure
296,"`` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said .",adventure
297,`` We'll stampede the rest .,adventure
298,You stay with the ladies .,adventure
299,"He added , `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' .",adventure
300,He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .,adventure
301,Susan halted Dean and kissed him .,adventure
302,"She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .",adventure
303,"He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness .",adventure
304,She too began to weep .,adventure
305,He released her and joined Mike .,adventure
306,"`` All right '' , he said .",adventure
307,"Mike only said , `` Later '' .",adventure
308,Susan said fiercely .,adventure
309,`` The way you were careful '' ? ?,adventure
310,He snorted .,adventure
311,`` Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock '' ? ?,adventure
312,He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .,adventure
313,Something all of them would regret .,adventure
314,"He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her .",adventure
315,"And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride .",adventure
316,He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .,adventure
317,"`` Stay well back of me '' , he said .",adventure
318,"Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade .",adventure
319,It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .,adventure
320,One wing stood open .,adventure
321,Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .,adventure
322,A voice spoke near-at-hand .,adventure
323,`` Who's that '' ? ?,adventure
324,"`` Is that you , Bill '' ? ?",adventure
325,He located his man .,adventure
326,The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .,adventure
327,Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .,adventure
328,But the luck that had been running their way left him .,adventure
329,The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .,adventure
330,He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .,adventure
331,"Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded .",adventure
332,The bullet went wide .,adventure
333,Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .,adventure
334,"This time it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him .",adventure
335,The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .,adventure
336,Dean came rushing up .,adventure
337,`` Are you hit '' ? ?,adventure
338,He demanded .,adventure
339,"`` No , but the fat's in the fire '' ! !",adventure
340,Mike said .,adventure
341,`` There's no chance now of all of us getting away .,adventure
342,You'll have to try it alone '' .,adventure
343,"The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need .",adventure
344,Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .,adventure
345,`` Up you go '' ! !,adventure
346,He said .,adventure
347,`` Ride '' ! !,adventure
348,Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse .,adventure
349,`` Why not you '' ? ?,adventure
350,He protested .,adventure
351,Mike said frantically .,adventure
352,`` You're lighter than me .,adventure
353,It's our only chance now .,adventure
354,Try to find these Feds .,adventure
355,The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back .,adventure
356,"Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .",adventure
357,`` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .,adventure
358,Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight .,adventure
359,You might need it .,adventure
360,"We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more .",adventure
361,I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' .,adventure
362,Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .,adventure
363,"`` McLish '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again '' .",adventure
364,Then he was on his way at a gallop .,adventure
365,"Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .",adventure
366,He lifted a screeching war whoop .,adventure
367,That touched off a total stampede .,adventure
368,He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .,adventure
369,These poured through the gate and joined the flight .,adventure
370,"The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .",adventure
371,`` Apaches '' ! !,adventure
372,Mike yelled .,adventure
373,`` They're stealin' the stock '' ! !,adventure
374,He crouched there .,adventure
375,His shout had been taken up and repeated .,adventure
376,The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses .,adventure
377,Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .,adventure
378,They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .,adventure
379,They followed the others toward the east gate .,adventure
380,Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches .,adventure
381,Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .,adventure
382,He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .,adventure
383,The area was deserted .,adventure
384,"A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade .",adventure
385,Mike crawled to the door and peered in .,adventure
386,The orderly room seemed to be deserted .,adventure
387,"A lantern hung from a peg , giving light .",adventure
388,"Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .",adventure
389,"An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .",adventure
390,"Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty .",adventure
391,He set his bundle down .,adventure
392,"Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .",adventure
393,"He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .",adventure
394,He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .,adventure
395,Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .,adventure
396,The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .,adventure
397,They realized the truth .,adventure
398,Bullets began to snap past him .,adventure
399,One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .,adventure
400,A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .,adventure
401,Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .,adventure
402,Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .,adventure
403,Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .,adventure
404,"She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .",adventure
405,Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .,adventure
406,"The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .",adventure
407,"He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls .",adventure
408,He peered from a loophole .,adventure
409,"Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .",adventure
410,Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .,adventure
411,He dropped a man with the first bullet .,adventure
412,At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .,adventure
413,That halted the rush .,adventure
414,The wagons were burning fiercely .,adventure
415,The mudwagon had caught fire also .,adventure
416,`` Gawdamighty '' ! !,adventure
417,One screeched .,adventure
418,`` There goes our grub an' ammunition '' ! !,adventure
419,`` Get a bucket line going '' ! !,adventure
420,`` Hurry ! !,adventure
421,The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .,adventure
422,But what few containers they found were inadequate .,adventure
423,"Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort .",adventure
424,Both buildings were in flames .,adventure
425,The heat drove the guerrillas back .,adventure
426,The roof of the command post began to buckle .,adventure
427,`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !,adventure
428,`` Run 'em right into the spring ! !,adventure
429,Hustle '' ! !,adventure
430,One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .,adventure
431,A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .,adventure
432,The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .,adventure
433,"The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound .",adventure
434,Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .,adventure
435,Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .,adventure
436,`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !,adventure
437,`` No .,adventure
438,"Now dammit , I don't want to go into any more explanations .",adventure
439,Here comes Jason .,adventure
440,Keep this to yourself '' .,adventure
441,"`` Anything wrong , cap'n ? ?",adventure
442,The men seem to think so '' .,adventure
443,`` Dirion found a large war party south of us .,adventure
444,"They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said .",adventure
445,He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .,adventure
446,"Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` Fort up ! !",adventure
447,There's a large war party on their way '' ! !,adventure
448,"For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .",adventure
449,Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .,adventure
450,The Aricaras treated us like friends .,adventure
451,Oso gave me an unruffled look .,adventure
452,"`` Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly .",adventure
453,`` What would you have done in Montero's moccasins ? ?,adventure
454,"Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? ?",adventure
455,He shook his head .,adventure
456,Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses .,adventure
457,"Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else .",adventure
458,The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero .,adventure
459,I saw that letter .,adventure
460,He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin '' .,adventure
461,"`` But that was war '' , I said .",adventure
462,`` There's no war on now '' .,adventure
463,"`` You're wrong , Matt .",adventure
464,"First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites .",adventure
465,And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land '' .,adventure
466,I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .,adventure
467,`` That's why this company's important .,adventure
468,That's why the Trust don't want us to make it .,adventure
469,That bastard Chambers ! !,adventure
470,-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! !,adventure
471,Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods .,adventure
472,"Well , talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up '' ! !",adventure
473,"For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet .",adventure
474,"More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .",adventure
475,"Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods .",adventure
476,"`` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly .",adventure
477,`` Let the savages kill each other .,adventure
478,What do we care '' ? ?,adventure
479,Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .,adventure
480,`` It was a terrible thing to do .,adventure
481,Those little children .,adventure
482,'',adventure
483,28 .,adventure
484,Attack,adventure
485,Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .,adventure
486,"Montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush .",adventure
487,He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .,adventure
488,The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;,adventure
489,the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .,adventure
490,Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .,adventure
491,"Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .",adventure
492,The worst part had been the waiting ; ;,adventure
493,"although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .",adventure
494,"Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl .",adventure
495,"Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ;",adventure
496,I didn't catch a wink .,adventure
497,"Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife .",adventure
498,It was a relief when they finally came .,adventure
499,"They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .",adventure
500,"`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' .",adventure
501,"`` That'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle .",adventure
502,"`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting .",adventure
503,`` Wait until my shot .,adventure
504,I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' .,adventure
505,I could see them in my sights .,adventure
506,They were about a mile off ; ;,adventure
507,under me the ground quivered slightly .,adventure
508,"At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .",adventure
509,Gradually they emerged as men .,adventure
510,Gray Eyes was in the lead .,adventure
511,"His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ;",adventure
512,jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .,adventure
513,He was naked except for a clout .,adventure
514,"His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .",adventure
515,I found his chest in my sights .,adventure
516,It had a red circle .,adventure
517,The circle came nearer and nearer .,adventure
518,"My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought .",adventure
519,Montero's rifle cracked .,adventure
520,Gray Eyes remained erect .,adventure
521,The feathered lance was still above his head .,adventure
522,"As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .",adventure
523,I squeezed the trigger .,adventure
524,At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .,adventure
525,"I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball .",adventure
526,He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .,adventure
527,He jerked once in the grass and lay still .,adventure
528,`` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! !,adventure
529,Kill 'em '' ! !,adventure
530,What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .,adventure
531,`` Lead up ! !,adventure
532,Lead up ! !,adventure
533,Montero was shouting .,adventure
534,Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .,adventure
535,"Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses .",adventure
536,"The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .",adventure
537,A rifle cracked ; ;,adventure
538,the square head fell over .,adventure
539,"His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him .",adventure
540,There was a ragged volley .,adventure
541,"`` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! !",adventure
542,Montero shouted furiously .,adventure
543,"The charge , I tell you '' ! !",adventure
544,The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .,adventure
545,"`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said .",adventure
546,"He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump .",adventure
547,I forgot to aim .,adventure
548,In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .,adventure
549,there was no doubt he was dying .,adventure
550,Again we waited for Montero .,adventure
551,"This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .",adventure
552,The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .,adventure
553,Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .,adventure
554,But a few reached our wall .,adventure
555,I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray .,adventure
556,I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone .,adventure
557,"A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight .",adventure
558,Men screamed .,adventure
559,"Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck .",adventure
560,"Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets .",adventure
561,"Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others .",adventure
562,"I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position .",adventure
563,The ponies were almost uncontrollable .,adventure
564,The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again .,adventure
565,It sounded like a man kicking a melon .,adventure
566,Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .,adventure
567,"I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .",adventure
568,"His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .",adventure
569,Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .,adventure
570,The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .,adventure
571,"It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses .",adventure
572,"Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs .",adventure
573,"Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts .",adventure
574,None of them reached our walls again .,adventure
575,The few survivors grudgingly turned away .,adventure
576,In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .,adventure
577,"She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .",adventure
578,"`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .",adventure
579,`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .,adventure
580,It would to me '' .,adventure
581,"`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly .",adventure
582,`` The fire's too big .,adventure
583,And I appreciate the advice '' .,adventure
584,"An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .",adventure
585,"`` I'm not advising you '' , she said .",adventure
586,`` I'm telling you .,adventure
587,That fire's too big .,adventure
588,Let it burn down .,adventure
589,He was taken aback .,adventure
590,It took him a long time to compose himself .,adventure
591,"`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally .",adventure
592,`` You're right about the fire .,adventure
593,"It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm .",adventure
594,But you're wrong about the rest of it .,adventure
595,I'm not leaving in the morning .,adventure
596,I own the place '' .,adventure
597,It didn't seem to tell her anything .,adventure
598,She studied it for a long time .,adventure
599,"Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it .",adventure
600,"She said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .",adventure
601,"`` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said .",adventure
602,Maybe you know him '' .,adventure
603,I ought to .,adventure
604,My father ran him off here six years ago '' .,adventure
605,Wilson didn't say anything .,adventure
606,"He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .",adventure
607,She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .,adventure
608,"`` Carwood didn't tell you that '' , she said .",adventure
609,"`` No '' , Wilson said .",adventure
610,`` But it's understandable .,adventure
611,It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .,adventure
612,And it doesn't make any difference .,adventure
613,He sold me a clear title .,adventure
614,"I have it with me , right here .",adventure
615,If you want to see '' --,adventure
616,"`` Never mind '' , she said sternly .",adventure
617,"`` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me .",adventure
618,I meant what I said about that fire .,adventure
619,That's all .,adventure
620,I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' .,adventure
621,"It was meant to insult him , and didn't quite succeed .",adventure
622,"He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .",adventure
623,`` It doesn't hurt .,adventure
624,"It might hurt you , though .",adventure
625,Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .,adventure
626,"He meant to say more , but he never got the chance .",adventure
627,She was quick .,adventure
628,"She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back .",adventure
629,"She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle .",adventure
630,"She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall .",adventure
631,"He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him .",adventure
632,"It made him a little sick , and he let go of her .",adventure
633,`` I ought to '' -- he said .,adventure
634,"He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps .",adventure
635,"`` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good .",adventure
636,If you were a man '' --,adventure
637,"`` She isn't , mister '' .",adventure
638,"The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned .",adventure
639,"The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees .",adventure
640,"But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .",adventure
641,"He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought .",adventure
642,"`` She's not a man , mister '' , he said .",adventure
643,`` I am .,adventure
644,He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest .,adventure
645,She seemed irritated .,adventure
646,`` I thought I told you to stay home '' .,adventure
647,The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap .,adventure
648,"his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless .",adventure
649,"`` You shouldn't be riding up here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly .",adventure
650,The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .,adventure
651,He took it without flinching .,adventure
652,"`` I said go home , Joseph .",adventure
653,The half-breed didn't answer this time .,adventure
654,"But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry .",adventure
655,It made Wilson wonder .,adventure
656,He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .,adventure
657,"They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out .",adventure
658,Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .,adventure
659,`` Who was that '' ? ?,adventure
660,He asked .,adventure
661,`` Your personal guard ? ?,adventure
662,You're pretty hard on him '' .,adventure
663,"`` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind .",adventure
664,`` He's a friend .,adventure
665,Is there anything else you want to know '' ? ?,adventure
666,"`` Not now '' , Wilson said .",adventure
667,You've got blood on your cheek .,adventure
668,Not yours .,adventure
669,Mine .,adventure
670,It must have got there when you fell against me '' .,adventure
671,She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .,adventure
672,"`` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said .",adventure
673,"`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now .",adventure
674,`` I've had enough of that .,adventure
675,I've had enough of you .,adventure
676,"I don't know what goes on around here , and I don't care .",adventure
677,"I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I don't care about that , either .",adventure
678,You took me by surprise .,adventure
679,But I'll know how to handle you next time '' .,adventure
680,"She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .",adventure
681,She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .,adventure
682,He had forgotten that she was so pretty .,adventure
683,"But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .",adventure
684,"He had known women like that , one woman in particular .",adventure
685,"He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .",adventure
686,"They weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .",adventure
687,"He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman .",adventure
688,"They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed .",adventure
689,And determined not to show it .,adventure
690,"They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .",adventure
691,"`` Go to sleep '' , he said .",adventure
692,`` Both of you .,adventure
693,There's better things to do than listen to something like that .,adventure
694,"I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' .",adventure
695,"Not tonight , at any rate .",adventure
696,He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .,adventure
697,He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .,adventure
698,"That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .",adventure
699,Not all of it .,adventure
700,But they were starting a new life .,adventure
701,The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .,adventure
702,"Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ;",adventure
703,"Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .",adventure
704,"The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard .",adventure
705,And there was a house ; ;,adventure
706,"livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs .",adventure
707,"In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain .",adventure
708,The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose .,adventure
709,There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet .,adventure
710,2,adventure
711,"They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .",adventure
712,"He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him .",adventure
713,"They were going to town , and they were both excited .",adventure
714,"Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they weren't going to town at all .",adventure
715,He had an uneasy feeling about it .,adventure
716,Judith Pierce .,adventure
717,It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .,adventure
718,"He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem .",adventure
719,"There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze .",adventure
720,But there was water .,adventure
721,"There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard .",adventure
722,"The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley .",adventure
723,"It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .",adventure
724,"A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .",adventure
725,"A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .",adventure
726,It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .,adventure
727,"The town was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; ;",adventure
728,The place was quiet .,adventure
729,Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ;,adventure
730,under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all .,adventure
731,I was nearly thirty at the time .,adventure
732,"It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; ;",adventure
733,only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it .,adventure
734,Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness .,adventure
735,"A glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most .",adventure
736,Drifting here and there .,adventure
737,"Squatting , as if waiting .",adventure
738,The pulsing glow of a cigarette .,adventure
739,The clerk paid them no attention .,adventure
740,"This impressed me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence .",adventure
741,His job simply consisted in registering new men .,adventure
742,When the phone rang he answered it .,adventure
743,"His authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further .",adventure
744,None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him .,adventure
745,"He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .",adventure
746,"He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath .",adventure
747,It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .,adventure
748,But it was not easy for him and he often slipped .,adventure
749,When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced .,adventure
750,I felt certain he was really a spineless little man .,adventure
751,"The morning's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines .",adventure
752,"Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .",adventure
753,Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person .,adventure
754,With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air .,adventure
755,When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .,adventure
756,He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .,adventure
757,"He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance .",adventure
758,What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .,adventure
759,"In the mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .",adventure
760,"They , and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office .",adventure
761,He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words .,adventure
762,"I was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning .",adventure
763,"Now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand .",adventure
764,Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient .,adventure
765,I withdrew my hand .,adventure
766,Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket .,adventure
767,"Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself .",adventure
768,"When suitably lighted , what would it look like ? ?",adventure
769,The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .,adventure
770,"One afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall .",adventure
771,By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time .,adventure
772,"I could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison .",adventure
773,"I had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself .",adventure
774,"I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell .",adventure
775,"It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light .",adventure
776,Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder .,adventure
777,"No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention .",adventure
778,"And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently .",adventure
779,I felt certain it was self-appointed .,adventure
780,It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here .,adventure
781,I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed .,adventure
782,"I felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance .",adventure
783,I lived in a state of suspense because of it .,adventure
784,Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning .,adventure
785,I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing .,adventure
786,"I did not despair , however ; ;",adventure
787,far from it ! !,adventure
788,I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall .,adventure
789,"Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me .",adventure
790,Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .,adventure
791,"The sounds issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me .",adventure
792,"The hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons .",adventure
793,It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before .,adventure
794,"Its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street .",adventure
795,"I kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall .",adventure
796,But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .,adventure
797,"For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there .",adventure
798,"I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk .",adventure
799,"As I had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .",adventure
800,Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer .,adventure
801,"At last , when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual .",adventure
802,"When I asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall .",adventure
803,"I could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o'clock .",adventure
804,The clerk impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock .,adventure
805,When I went for my interview with the director I saw why .,adventure
806,Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people .,adventure
807,Cigarette butts littered the floor .,adventure
808,I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs .,adventure
809,The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men .,adventure
810,I stopped by the counter .,adventure
811,"No one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open .",adventure
812,"Past it I could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor .",adventure
813,The director's office .,adventure
814,I rapped my knuckles on the counter .,adventure
815,"He was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ;",adventure
816,"he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar .",adventure
817,"He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ;",adventure
818,they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment .,adventure
819,"But he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application .",adventure
820,"I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times .",adventure
821,He did not look at them now .,adventure
822,Why had I registered ? ?,adventure
823,He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ;,adventure
824,"indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them .",adventure
825,"Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ? ?",adventure
826,"What sort of men I would come into contact with , at the hall ? ?",adventure
827,These questions did not surprise me ; ;,adventure
828,"I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place .",adventure
829,"Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying .",adventure
830,"I had always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands .",adventure
831,"This desire , I went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing .",adventure
832,To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence .,adventure
833,"The flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head .",adventure
834,`` Tie him up '' .,adventure
835,"Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard .",adventure
836,"The man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor .",adventure
837,"Barton said harshly , `` Why did you do that '' ? ?",adventure
838,Rankin sneered at him .,adventure
839,"`` What did you want me to do , kiss him ? ?",adventure
840,He dumped me in solitary twice '' .,adventure
841,The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out .,adventure
842,Fred Rankin looked at him .,adventure
843,"It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now .",adventure
844,`` Come on .,adventure
845,"They filed out through the guard-room door , into the paved square .",adventure
846,"There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks .",adventure
847,There was no moon .,adventure
848,They had chosen this night purposely .,adventure
849,"They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and Powers slipped through the door .",adventure
850,"Two men were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed .",adventure
851,`` What are you doing out of the block '' ? ?,adventure
852,"`` It's Curtiss '' , he said , naming the man Rankin had hit .",adventure
853,`` I've got to have help '' .,adventure
854,They stared at him .,adventure
855,The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .,adventure
856,`` What's wrong with him '' ? ?,adventure
857,The sergeant turned to the door .,adventure
858,As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side .,adventure
859,The sergeant froze .,adventure
860,Powers had not followed .,adventure
861,Powers was covering the remaining guard .,adventure
862,The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell .,adventure
863,Powers knocked his arm aside .,adventure
864,"Deliberately , with none of Rankin's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head .",adventure
865,They were free .,adventure
866,Even Barton could not quite believe it .,adventure
867,"They slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground .",adventure
868,Five minutes later they reached the horses .,adventure
869,He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short .,adventure
870,No one hurried .,adventure
871,"They walked the horses , heading along the river , Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night .",adventure
872,"The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts .",adventure
873,Five miles .,adventure
874,"In a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees .",adventure
875,"A good man , Emmett .",adventure
876,"He had been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial .",adventure
877,It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison .,adventure
878,"Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt .",adventure
879,"Kid Boyd was unusually silent , Rankin watchful , a few paces apart .",adventure
880,Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers .,adventure
881,`` I won't even try to thank you '' .,adventure
882,I did it for the valley .,adventure
883,We've been starving and I don't like to starve '' .,adventure
884,"Barton turned away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse .",adventure
885,`` Good luck '' .,adventure
886,`` Meaning you want me to ride out '' ? ?,adventure
887,`` You aren't one of us .,adventure
888,There's nothing for you here '' .,adventure
889,`` I got no place to go '' .,adventure
890,Barton hesitated .,adventure
891,"He did not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct .",adventure
892,But ten years in prison had taught him realities .,adventure
893,"They were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money .",adventure
894,"It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night Riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure .",adventure
895,"But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side .",adventure
896,"`` Your choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to Kid Boyd .",adventure
897,"Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank .",adventure
898,"He wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley .",adventure
899,"He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco .",adventure
900,"He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money .",adventure
901,He had done time for the theft .,adventure
902,Both hated Donald Kruger .,adventure
903,"It had drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape .",adventure
904,"He said now , `` I've got the perfect headquarters set up .",adventure
905,Mitch Barton knew the place .,adventure
906,Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley .,adventure
907,"They had spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel .",adventure
908,Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .,adventure
909,"`` The road's washed badly '' , said Dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse .",adventure
910,A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' .,adventure
911,Barton nodded .,adventure
912,`` How do the valley people feel '' ? ?,adventure
913,`` As mad as ever .,adventure
914,"But Kruger's men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me .",adventure
915,I'm an outsider .,adventure
916,"When they learn you're in the hills though , they'll rally , don't worry about that '' .",adventure
917,"Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind .",adventure
918,`` My boy .,adventure
919,Did you find him '' ? ?,adventure
920,"Dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension .",adventure
921,`` He's in Morgan's Ferry '' .,adventure
922,Barton half-straightened in surprise .,adventure
923,`` What's he doing there '' ? ?,adventure
924,Again Dill hesitated .,adventure
925,`` Dealing faro '' .,adventure
926,`` Dealing faro ? ?,adventure
927,How come '' ? ?,adventure
928,`` Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon '' .,adventure
929,"After another long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are '' ? ?",adventure
930,`` Everyone .,adventure
931,"He's quite a rat , you know .",adventure
932,He sold out to Kruger's men .,adventure
933,He's informed them of everything you've ever written him .,adventure
934,He wants your ranch '' .,adventure
935,"He said tensely , `` All right .",adventure
936,`` I was afraid of this .,adventure
937,I almost didn't tell you '' .,adventure
938,`` If you hadn't I'd have killed you '' .,adventure
939,`` But you can't ride into the Ferry .,adventure
940,That's what they'll expect you to do .,adventure
941,They'll be there waiting for you .,adventure
942,'',adventure
943,`` The hell you do '' .,adventure
944,Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it .,adventure
945,`` I never saw him .,adventure
946,My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away .,adventure
947,`` I can't leave him there .,adventure
948,"Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care .",adventure
949,Chapter two,adventure
950,"It was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state .",adventure
951,It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame .,adventure
952,It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield .,adventure
953,It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .,adventure
954,"For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence .",adventure
955,Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit .,adventure
956,"The office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove .",adventure
957,The building was dwarfed by the scene outside .,adventure
958,There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside .,adventure
959,"The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth .",adventure
960,"It was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire hoses , and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices .",adventure
961,A million dollars' of gold a month .,adventure
962,A million tons of rock and soil and brush .,adventure
963,The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day .,adventure
964,"Their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles .",adventure
965,"Hague , like all who worked near the pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums .",adventure
966,"He was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air .",adventure
967,Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .,adventure
968,"Ten years older than Mitch Barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation .",adventure
969,"He was proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him .",adventure
970,He lived and breathed for the mining company .,adventure
971,"No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life .",adventure
972,There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room .,adventure
973,Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke .,adventure
974,Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke .,adventure
975,He knew nothing about the man's history .,adventure
976,Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger .,adventure
977,Kodyke was to head the dread company police .,adventure
978,He ran the change rooms .,adventure
979,He threw out the hi-graders .,adventure
980,Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike .,adventure
981,He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype .,adventure
982,He broke out of Folsom last night .,adventure
983,Apparently he bribed one of the guards .,adventure
984,We want him back there or we want him dead '' .,adventure
985,"Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully .",adventure
986,`` Dangerous '' ? ?,adventure
987,"`` Dangerous , yes .",adventure
988,You know how the ranchers in the valley are .,adventure
989,They blame us for all their troubles .,adventure
990,Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches .,adventure
991,It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them .,adventure
992,We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again '' .,adventure
993,"The gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing .",adventure
994,"Normally Hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said .",adventure
995,"If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it .",adventure
996,"After they had finished eating , Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm -- `` so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother .",adventure
997,"When they reached their neighbor's house , Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again .",adventure
998,"Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination .",adventure
999,"As she drove , she thought about her plan .",adventure
1000,It was really quite simple .,adventure
1001,"So simple , in fact , that it might even work -- although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance .",adventure
1002,She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .,adventure
1003,"When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped .",adventure
1004,"All of her movements were careful and methodical , partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime .",adventure
1005,"She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house .",adventure
1006,"Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom .",adventure
1007,"On her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving -- an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major Hiram Munroe Culver .",adventure
1008,"If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .",adventure
1009,"Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house .",adventure
1010,"There was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom .",adventure
1011,"Atonement , if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin .",adventure
1012,"It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness .",adventure
1013,"Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought .",adventure
1014,Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .,adventure
1015,"The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand .",adventure
1016,"Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time .",adventure
1017,"It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all .",adventure
1018,No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning .,adventure
1019,Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed .,adventure
1020,"Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ?",adventure
1021,Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .,adventure
1022,"She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .",adventure
1023,"Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them .",adventure
1024,"A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ;",adventure
1025,"today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable .",adventure
1026,She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ;,adventure
1027,she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal .,adventure
1028,"If , as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that omen .",adventure
1029,Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity ; ;,adventure
1030,she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest .,adventure
1031,The forest took on an impersonal aspect .,adventure
1032,"It did not care what sort of person prowled its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes .",adventure
1033,"Unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter .",adventure
1034,knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man .,adventure
1035,Pamela shook her head .,adventure
1036,She must not think about time .,adventure
1037,That was another one of those traps .,adventure
1038,"If , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand .",adventure
1039,How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent ? ?,adventure
1040,"Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor .",adventure
1041,Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near .,adventure
1042,His presence would have interfered with her duty .,adventure
1043,The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .,adventure
1044,"Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction .",adventure
1045,"She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles .",adventure
1046,"It was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time .",adventure
1047,"At one and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry .",adventure
1048,Silence came into the forest -- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees .,adventure
1049,"Silence walked at Pamela's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear .",adventure
1050,She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth .,adventure
1051,"In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone .",adventure
1052,She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes .,adventure
1053,"Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain .",adventure
1054,She was bewildered .,adventure
1055,She seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees .,adventure
1056,"She stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her .",adventure
1057,She was standing in a thick grove .,adventure
1058,"The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting out the sun completely .",adventure
1059,The earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays .,adventure
1060,"She had the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain .",adventure
1061,The thought made Pamela shudder .,adventure
1062,A terrible chill swept through the grove .,adventure
1063,"Not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching Pamela in a leering embrace .",adventure
1064,Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene ? ?,adventure
1065,"She already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive .",adventure
1066,"It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin .",adventure
1067,"It crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples .",adventure
1068,"It circled her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles .",adventure
1069,"It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached ; ;",adventure
1070,stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps ; ;,adventure
1071,clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws .,adventure
1072,"She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight .",adventure
1073,But she did not know which way to go .,adventure
1074,"The shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove .",adventure
1075,She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles .,adventure
1076,"She could not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen ? ?",adventure
1077,Does the mountain listen ? ?,adventure
1078,Pamela groped blindly .,adventure
1079,She had to escape .,adventure
1080,She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place .,adventure
1081,She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back .,adventure
1082,"Her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed .",adventure
1083,Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy .,adventure
1084,Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; ;,adventure
1085,bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ;,adventure
1086,"Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement .",adventure
1087,"She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him .",adventure
1088,`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord .,adventure
1089,But '' --,adventure
1090,"`` But it don't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly .",adventure
1091,"`` To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the sweetest flower that grows '' .",adventure
1092,She yanked away from him furiously .,adventure
1093,`` You shut up ! !,adventure
1094,Shu-tt up-pp ! !,adventure
1095,"I've got something to say to you , and by God you're going to listen .",adventure
1096,Do you hear me ? ?,adventure
1097,You're going to listen '' ! !,adventure
1098,Lord nodded agreeably .,adventure
1099,"He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin' to the ear , and he didn't want to miss a word of it .",adventure
1100,So would she mind speaking a little louder ? ?,adventure
1101,"`` I think you stink , Tom Lord ! !",adventure
1102,"I think you're mean and hateful and stupid , and -- louder '' ? ?",adventure
1103,Said Joyce .,adventure
1104,`` Uh-huh .,adventure
1105,So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car .,adventure
1106,He opened the door and got out .,adventure
1107,"He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly .",adventure
1108,`` Well ? ?,adventure
1109,Wasn't you goin' to say somethin' '' ? ?,adventure
1110,"Then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , huh ? ?",adventure
1111,"Print it in real big letters , an' I can cipher it out later '' .",adventure
1112,"`` Aah , go on '' , she said .",adventure
1113,`` Just go the hell on '' .,adventure
1114,"Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring .",adventure
1115,"Never , he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun .",adventure
1116,"And he really feels that way , she thought .",adventure
1117,"That's really all he's got , all he is .",adventure
1118,Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .,adventure
1119,If I could make myself feel the same way,adventure
1120,"She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; ;",adventure
1121,against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .,adventure
1122,"Here in the God-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible .",adventure
1123,"He was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine-chiseled features .",adventure
1124,"But she'd known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left ? ?",adventure
1125,He wasn't a big man ; ;,adventure
1126,rather on the medium side .,adventure
1127,Neither was he very powerful of build .,adventure
1128,And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .,adventure
1129,"Just nothing , she told herself .",adventure
1130,"But , by gosh , I want him and I'm going to have him ! !",adventure
1131,"He caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer ; ;",adventure
1132,"teetering , half-mincing walk .",adventure
1133,"He slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her .",adventure
1134,"`` Oh , cut it out , Tom '' ! !",adventure
1135,She snapped .,adventure
1136,"`` This ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested .",adventure
1137,`` Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar '' ? ?,adventure
1138,"`` I feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like ! !",adventure
1139,"Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? ?",adventure
1140,"`` Might get there faster walkin' '' , Lord drawled , `` seein' as how I got a busted front spring .",adventure
1141,"On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn't either .",adventure
1142,There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' .,adventure
1143,"`` Now , ain't it the truth '' ? ?",adventure
1144,Lord laughed with secret amusement .,adventure
1145,"`` Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me '' .",adventure
1146,For God's sake '' ! !,adventure
1147,`` Looky '' .,adventure
1148,"He pointed , cutting her off .",adventure
1149,"sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town .",adventure
1150,"He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others .",adventure
1151,`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? ?,adventure
1152,Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? ?,adventure
1153,"`` What else would I mean , anyways '' ? ?",adventure
1154,"In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ;",adventure
1155,"that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever .",adventure
1156,"Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum -- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood .",adventure
1157,"The car lurched along at a snail's crawl , the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .",adventure
1158,"He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned .",adventure
1159,"Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension .",adventure
1160,"It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .",adventure
1161,"Joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .",adventure
1162,"That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company .",adventure
1163,"Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line .",adventure
1164,He had a legitimate reason for wearing it .,adventure
1165,"It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields .",adventure
1166,"Moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it .",adventure
1167,"He demanded , when Lord confronted him .",adventure
1168,"I'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit '' .",adventure
1169,By failing to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into Lord's hands .,adventure
1170,The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest .,adventure
1171,"So , `` How about it '' ? ?",adventure
1172,He said .,adventure
1173,`` Why single me out on this permit deal '' ? ?,adventure
1174,"`` Well , I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him .",adventure
1175,"Don't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case .",adventure
1176,Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots '' .,adventure
1177,McBride reddened .,adventure
1178,"He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable .",adventure
1179,"`` Look , Lord '' , he said hoarsely .",adventure
1180,"`` I know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe I can't blame you .",adventure
1181,"But you're all wrong , man ! !",adventure
1182,"I just do what I'm told , and '' --",adventure
1183,`` uh-huh .,adventure
1184,An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks .,adventure
1185,"So you get rid of that pistol right now , Mis-ter McBride .",adventure
1186,You do that or take you out a permit right now '' .,adventure
1187,"McBride couldn't do either , of course .",adventure
1188,"Not immediately , as the deputy demanded .",adventure
1189,Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .,adventure
1190,To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .,adventure
1191,Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot .,adventure
1192,"How could he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line , as he had to -- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown ? ?",adventure
1193,"`` I'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately .",adventure
1194,"`` Just as soon as I go to the bank , and '' --",adventure
1195,`` huh-uh .,adventure
1196,"Now , Mis-ter McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm .",adventure
1197,"It was strictly the deputy's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in .",adventure
1198,It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition .,adventure
1199,"Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine .",adventure
1200,"Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut .",adventure
1201,A rabbit punch redoubled him .,adventure
1202,"And then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach",adventure
1203,But he couldn't keep up with them .,adventure
1204,No more could he defend himself against them .,adventure
1205,I meant him no harm .,adventure
1206,I've given willful hurt to no man .,adventure
1207,"I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me .",adventure
1208,Beat me to death in front of a hundred people .,adventure
1209,Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .,adventure
1210,"He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically .",adventure
1211,"Fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again .",adventure
1212,He couldn't see ; ;,adventure
1213,he was long past the point of coherent thinking .,adventure
1214,"This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; ;",adventure
1215,And nothing would be done about it .,adventure
1216,Nothing unless,adventure
1217,Donna ! !,adventure
1218,Donna was like he was .,adventure
1219,"She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance .",adventure
1220,And Donna would --,adventure
1221,"When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house , in the office of Doctor Lord , the deputy's deceased father .",adventure
1222,The Brannon outfit -- known as the Slash-B because of its brand -- reached Hondo Creek before sundown .,adventure
1223,The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground .,adventure
1224,"Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd .",adventure
1225,"They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about .",adventure
1226,But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit .,adventure
1227,"He'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon .",adventure
1228,He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven .,adventure
1229,Supper would be ready within the hour .,adventure
1230,The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby .,adventure
1231,Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon .,adventure
1232,"Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing .",adventure
1233,"Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon .",adventure
1234,"Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday .",adventure
1235,"He'd come alone , without his wife and child .",adventure
1236,He'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him .,adventure
1237,"She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife .",adventure
1238,"Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .",adventure
1239,"But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .",adventure
1240,"`` Pat , get out of that creek ! !",adventure
1241,"You too , Sean ! !",adventure
1242,"Elena , you'll get mud all over your dress '' ! !",adventure
1243,"Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon .",adventure
1244,"Tomas , she called him -- as the Mexican hands did .",adventure
1245,Whatever they are talking about ? ?,adventure
1246,Conchita wondered .,adventure
1247,It bothered her that she probably would never know .,adventure
1248,"Certainly , she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward .",adventure
1249,"At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything .",adventure
1250,"They were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon .",adventure
1251,"Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him .",adventure
1252,He held a cigarette in his right hand .,adventure
1253,"It was burning away , forgotten .",adventure
1254,His face was clouded with unhappiness .,adventure
1255,He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do .,adventure
1256,"Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you wouldn't heed it '' .",adventure
1257,"`` Let's hear it , anyway '' .",adventure
1258,`` Wait a little while .,adventure
1259,Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time .,adventure
1260,Give her time to miss you .,adventure
1261,"After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy .",adventure
1262,You need her even more than you need him '' .,adventure
1263,"`` She won't change her mind '' , Brannon said .",adventure
1264,`` John Clayton will see to that '' .,adventure
1265,`` But after a time away from you .,adventure
1266,'',adventure
1267,"`` A year , Luis ? ?",adventure
1268,Five ? ?,adventure
1269,"`` Maybe in a year , Tomas .",adventure
1270,'',adventure
1271,"`` In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me '' , Brannon said flatly .",adventure
1272,`` And the boy will be too much under his influence by then .,adventure
1273,I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether .,adventure
1274,"Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father '' ! !",adventure
1275,"`` That I can't answer , for I can't imagine something like this happening to me .",adventure
1276,Maybe I should withdraw my advice -- no '' ? ?,adventure
1277,Brannon looked at Hank Maguire .,adventure
1278,`` And you ? ?,adventure
1279,What would you do in my place '' ? ?,adventure
1280,Hank shook his head .,adventure
1281,"`` I don't know , Tom .",adventure
1282,"Like Luis , I can't see something like this happening to me .",adventure
1283,"With Maria and me , there's never any problem .",adventure
1284,"Where I go , she goes -- and the kids with us .",adventure
1285,You're going to need your woman .,adventure
1286,"If you take the one , you'd better take both '' .",adventure
1287,Brannon shook his head .,adventure
1288,`` I won't force Beth to come against her will .,adventure
1289,But I'm going to have my son '' .,adventure
1290,"They were silent for a little while , each looking glum .",adventure
1291,"Finally Luis Hernandez said , `` What must be , must be .",adventure
1292,"I am with you , of course , Tomas '' .",adventure
1293,"`` All right '' , Brannon said , rising .",adventure
1294,Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall .,adventure
1295,They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .,adventure
1296,During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east .,adventure
1297,"Later , they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside Rockfork , they ran into rain .",adventure
1298,"There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff .",adventure
1299,It was to be nothing more than that .,adventure
1300,He didn't want to put himself outside the law .,adventure
1301,"With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis's son Pedro .",adventure
1302,The Ramirez brothers were also along .,adventure
1303,"The seventh man was Red Hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising .",adventure
1304,They were all good men .,adventure
1305,"It was dark early , because of the storm .",adventure
1306,"Also because of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted .",adventure
1307,Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour .,adventure
1308,"They reined in before the town marshal's office , a box-sized building on Main Street .",adventure
1309,He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .,adventure
1310,"`` Probably just stepped out '' , he said .",adventure
1311,`` Maybe to have supper .,adventure
1312,"Red , come along .",adventure
1313,The rest of you wait here '' .,adventure
1314,"With Red Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe .",adventure
1315,Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .,adventure
1316,"`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse .",adventure
1317,`` Maybe he's at the hotel '' .,adventure
1318,"They rode to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street .",adventure
1319,"They reined in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room .",adventure
1320,Brannon had no slicker .,adventure
1321,He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked .,adventure
1322,But he felt no physical discomfort .,adventure
1323,He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .,adventure
1324,He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder .,adventure
1325,"Hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal .",adventure
1326,`` Sitting with a cup of coffee now .,adventure
1327,"He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain .",adventure
1328,"It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late .",adventure
1329,`` Don't start anything you can't finish '' .,adventure
1330,`` We'll talk over at your office '' .,adventure
1331,"`` Brannon , I warn you '' ! !",adventure
1332,Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm .,adventure
1333,They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office .,adventure
1334,"The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room .",adventure
1335,His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .,adventure
1336,"`` I'll remember you '' , he said .",adventure
1337,`` Every last one of you .,adventure
1338,"As for you , Brannon '' --",adventure
1339,"`` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal '' .",adventure
1340,"`` Now , hold on , damn it ; ;",adventure
1341,I won't '' --,adventure
1342,Red Hogan's patience ran out .,adventure
1343,"He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk .",adventure
1344,"`` Too much fooling around '' , he said .",adventure
1345,"`` Don't press your luck , badge-toter '' .",adventure
1346,"Brannon said , `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal '' .",adventure
1347,Macklin said .,adventure
1348,`` Can't you guess '' ? ?,adventure
1349,Brannon said .,adventure
1350,`` We're putting you where you won't come to harm .,adventure
1351,Come on -- the key .,adventure
1352,Get it out '' ! !,adventure
1353,"Brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and '' --",adventure
1354,"They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides .",adventure
1355,"No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .",adventure
1356,"He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure .",adventure
1357,"He swore , and said , `` All right .",adventure
1358,"`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered .",adventure
1359,"Then , as Macklin obeyed : `` Now let's go out back '' .",adventure
1360,"Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door .",adventure
1361,"They crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in .",adventure
1362,"Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building .",adventure
1363,Its windows glowed with lamplight .,adventure
1364,"Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark .",adventure
1365,`` Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you '' .,adventure
1366,"He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house .",adventure
1367,Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering .,adventure
1368,The others followed Brannon inside .,adventure
1369,"They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house .",adventure
1370,"They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .",adventure
1371,"They tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet .",adventure
1372,And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard .,adventure
1373,For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second .,adventure
1374,"But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction .",adventure
1375,"For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .",adventure
1376,The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis .,adventure
1377,"After walking out to his corral that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet .",adventure
1378,He'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come .,adventure
1379,But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted .,adventure
1380,There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .,adventure
1381,Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .,adventure
1382,He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread .,adventure
1383,His land had never been plowed .,adventure
1384,He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it .,adventure
1385,"He had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them .",adventure
1386,He had cursed at them and threatened them .,adventure
1387,"He was a man , those neighbors testified later , who didn't have a friend in the world .",adventure
1388,"William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .",adventure
1389,`` I'll be ready next time '' ! !,adventure
1390,"This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area .",adventure
1391,`` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face '' ! !,adventure
1392,He exploded .,adventure
1393,`` That's all I ask '' ! !,adventure
1394,He never got that chance .,adventure
1395,A bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest .,adventure
1396,"He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself .",adventure
1397,"Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground .",adventure
1398,"Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting attorney , a Colonel Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning .",adventure
1399,It took some time to locate Horn .,adventure
1400,"He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County , two counties away .",adventure
1401,Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .,adventure
1402,But that indictment was never made .,adventure
1403,"For Tom Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing .",adventure
1404,The authorities had to release him .,adventure
1405,"He immediately rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends .",adventure
1406,"`` Dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said '' ! !",adventure
1407,He'd grin .,adventure
1408,You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? ?,adventure
1409,"Publicly , he denied everything .",adventure
1410,"Privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin .",adventure
1411,For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do .,adventure
1412,"Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money's worth .",adventure
1413,A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .,adventure
1414,"But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors .",adventure
1415,The rustling problem was by no means solved .,adventure
1416,For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on -- a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell .,adventure
1417,"`` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later .",adventure
1418,"`` Everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about Lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself '' ! !",adventure
1419,"On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work .",adventure
1420,"Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping .",adventure
1421,Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded .,adventure
1422,"He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest .",adventure
1423,The hired man ran over to help his boss .,adventure
1424,"`` My God , I'm shot '' ! !",adventure
1425,Powell gasped .,adventure
1426,And he collapsed and died instantly .,adventure
1427,Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .,adventure
1428,"He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast .",adventure
1429,"But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing .",adventure
1430,A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place .,adventure
1431,There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .,adventure
1432,Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .,adventure
1433,"Once again , Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately .",adventure
1434,"Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .",adventure
1435,"Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made .",adventure
1436,"`` Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd blandly announce .",adventure
1437,`` And I sort o' got a corner on the market '' .,adventure
1438,"`` Tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers ? ?",adventure
1439,"They wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' .",adventure
1440,"Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend .",adventure
1441,"`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope ? ?",adventure
1442,Which would you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down '' ? ?,adventure
1443,"`` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree .",adventure
1444,"`` But well , it just don't seem sportin' somehow '' ! !",adventure
1445,The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .,adventure
1446,He echoed again in soft wonder .,adventure
1447,"I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls .",adventure
1448,I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death .,adventure
1449,"But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man '' ! !",adventure
1450,"After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored .",adventure
1451,The lesson had been learned .,adventure
1452,The examples were plain .,adventure
1453,"If you don't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell's was .",adventure
1454,This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .,adventure
1455,"Keane left , within three days .",adventure
1456,"All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same .",adventure
1457,"Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards .",adventure
1458,The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .,adventure
1459,"For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known .",adventure
1460,"It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state .",adventure
1461,"( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found .",adventure
1462,) Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark .,adventure
1463,( A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest .,adventure
1464,),adventure
1465,"One thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary .",adventure
1466,The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week .,adventure
1467,"`` My reputation's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once .",adventure
1468,He evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end .,adventure
1469,He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders .,adventure
1470,"But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure .",adventure
1471,Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown .,adventure
1472,"He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups .",adventure
1473,"In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .",adventure
1474,"The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life .",adventure
1475,"The wailing , guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him .",adventure
1476,"When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable , Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter .",adventure
1477,"`` I have a little job for you , Charlie .",adventure
1478,"Brenner's voice was oily , but Summers wasn't fooled .",adventure
1479,He moistened his lips uneasily .,adventure
1480,"`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? ?",adventure
1481,Brenner shrugged carelessly .,adventure
1482,`` It's very simple .,adventure
1483,I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari .,adventure
1484,Tell her to come here to the hotel '' .,adventure
1485,"Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door .",adventure
1486,"`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said .",adventure
1487,`` You're not to mention my name .,adventure
1488,Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her '' .,adventure
1489,"Summers pulled up short , and turned around .",adventure
1490,"`` I don't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans .",adventure
1491,"`` It doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that .",adventure
1492,Couldn't I just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence .,adventure
1493,"Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold .",adventure
1494,He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed .,adventure
1495,"`` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully .",adventure
1496,"If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack '' .",adventure
1497,"He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams's room , that Adams is in trouble .",adventure
1498,Tell her to hurry '' .,adventure
1499,`` Yes sir '' .,adventure
1500,Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching .,adventure
1501,"He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside .",adventure
1502,"The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong , but Curt didn't interpret it this way .",adventure
1503,A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed .,adventure
1504,From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street .,adventure
1505,"Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees .",adventure
1506,Curt circled the house and located a barn out back .,adventure
1507,"He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else .",adventure
1508,"There was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened .",adventure
1509,"Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor .",adventure
1510,"He moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition .",adventure
1511,"Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws .",adventure
1512,He found a match in his pocket and lit it .,adventure
1513,"There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin .",adventure
1514,Curt snuffed out the match .,adventure
1515,"It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black .",adventure
1516,He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved .,adventure
1517,"As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open .",adventure
1518,Curt moved over beside the door and waited .,adventure
1519,"Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's smothered curses .",adventure
1520,'',adventure
1521,The horse continued to snort .,adventure
1522,Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice .,adventure
1523,"Jess cursed again , and entered the barn .",adventure
1524,"A match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop .",adventure
1525,"As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer .",adventure
1526,"`` Before you try anything '' , he said .",adventure
1527,`` Remember what happened to Gruller '' .,adventure
1528,Jess caught his breath in surprise .,adventure
1529,"He started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it .",adventure
1530,"`` That's the stuff '' , Curt said .",adventure
1531,`` Just hold it that way '' .,adventure
1532,He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt .,adventure
1533,You won't be needing this '' .,adventure
1534,`` We ain't got nothing to talk about .,adventure
1535,"If I don't come back in the house , Breed's going to '' --",adventure
1536,`` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house .,adventure
1537,About now he's probably having supper .,adventure
1538,Jess turned .,adventure
1539,"There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen .",adventure
1540,"`` You're about as dumb as they come , Adams .",adventure
1541,"I don't know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' --",adventure
1542,"`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said .",adventure
1543,`` It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about '' .,adventure
1544,Jess stiffened .,adventure
1545,"I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; ;",adventure
1546,"one with blood all over it , Arbuckle's blood '' .",adventure
1547,Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .,adventure
1548,"`` So help me , Crouch , I'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I'm going to hear you admit killing him .",adventure
1549,Now start talking .,adventure
1550,Who told you to do it ? ?,adventure
1551,Was it Dutch Brenner '' ? ?,adventure
1552,Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand .,adventure
1553,"Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it .",adventure
1554,"Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold .",adventure
1555,"`` Having all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , Adams ? ?",adventure
1556,"If we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' .",adventure
1557,Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster .,adventure
1558,He retreated a step and holstered his own .,adventure
1559,"`` All right , Crouch ; ;",adventure
1560,we're on even terms .,adventure
1561,Now draw '' ! !,adventure
1562,Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face .,adventure
1563,"The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he didn't reach for the gun .",adventure
1564,"`` Does this make it any easier , coward '' ? ?",adventure
1565,"`` I ain't drawin' against you '' , Jess said thickly .",adventure
1566,`` I heard how you outdrew Chico .,adventure
1567,I just wanted to hear you say so '' .,adventure
1568,Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .,adventure
1569,Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .,adventure
1570,"He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate .",adventure
1571,"Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin .",adventure
1572,He dropped his own beside it .,adventure
1573,Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist .,adventure
1574,With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack .,adventure
1575,"Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section .",adventure
1576,It was like hitting a sack of salt .,adventure
1577,"Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .",adventure
1578,"He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning .",adventure
1579,An inch lower and it would have knocked him out .,adventure
1580,"As it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move .",adventure
1581,"When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork .",adventure
1582,"Curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor .",adventure
1583,Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .,adventure
1584,It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .,adventure
1585,"The tines broke off under Jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out .",adventure
1586,so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head .,adventure
1587,By now Curt was seeing clearly again .,adventure
1588,"He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them .",adventure
1589,They made Jess double over .,adventure
1590,"When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .",adventure
1591,Jess didn't seem too sure himself .,adventure
1592,"He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall .",adventure
1593,Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor .,adventure
1594,Jess had had enough .,adventure
1595,"Blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists .",adventure
1596,`` Tell me about Arbuckle ! !,adventure
1597,"You killed him , didn't you '' ? ?",adventure
1598,"`` It was Brenner's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose .",adventure
1599,`` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .,adventure
1600,He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' .,adventure
1601,"`` You mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said .",adventure
1602,"Turning his back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal's face .",adventure
1603,The buckskin bolted out of the stall .,adventure
1604,"He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster .",adventure
1605,"Leaving Jess's where it lay , he left the stall .",adventure
1606,We're going someplace '' .,adventure
1607,Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .,adventure
1608,`` Who's in there '' ? ?,adventure
1609,Black called fearfully .,adventure
1610,`` You're staying right here for a while .,adventure
1611,This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle .,adventure
1612,"He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess .",adventure
1613,`` Get out of here .,adventure
1614,"You're coming along peacefully , or I'll put a bullet in your leg '' .",adventure
1615,Jess stumbled through the door .,adventure
1616,"Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it .",adventure
1617,"Black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes .",adventure
1618,`` Where're you takin' me '' ? ?,adventure
1619,Jess asked worriedly .,adventure
1620,`` We're going to Marshal Woods's house .,adventure
1621,"Maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it'll make a difference .",adventure
1622,Somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' .,adventure
1623,Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces .,adventure
1624,"`` Honey '' , he whispered .",adventure
1625,"`` Soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves '' .",adventure
1626,"`` Sally '' , admonished her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan .",adventure
1627,His wounds need dressing now '' .,adventure
1628,Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting .,adventure
1629,He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap .,adventure
1630,"`` Got a lot to tend to , but I'll get back quick as I can '' , he assured her .",adventure
1631,Jackson was doing most of the talking .,adventure
1632,"So long as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle , Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth .",adventure
1633,there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening .,adventure
1634,"Damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve .",adventure
1635,"If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did , my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell ! !",adventure
1636,"He stooped , picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully .",adventure
1637,"From the way the wound in his head was itching , Dan knew that it would heal .",adventure
1638,But his only hat was something else again .,adventure
1639,`` Nate ! !,adventure
1640,Nate '' ! !,adventure
1641,`` Nate '' ! !,adventure
1642,He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him .,adventure
1643,"Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice .",adventure
1644,`` I know you ain't '' ! !,adventure
1645,"Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall .",adventure
1646,"He moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own .",adventure
1647,"`` Here's a present for you '' , he said , shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead .",adventure
1648,`` Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by '' ! !,adventure
1649,"Slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight .",adventure
1650,"Much as they had to look forward to , they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go .",adventure
1651,At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes .,adventure
1652,"She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness .",adventure
1653,"And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon .",adventure
1654,"Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all .",adventure
1655,"Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa ! !",adventure
1656,Pa ! !,adventure
1657,I can see Dan .,adventure
1658,And he's with the Jacksons '' ! !,adventure
1659,`` What about Burnsides '' ? ?,adventure
1660,"Hez asked , who still believed they'd have them to lick .",adventure
1661,`` They ain't even in sight '' ! !,adventure
1662,She replied .,adventure
1663,"By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others .",adventure
1664,"Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .",adventure
1665,But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .,adventure
1666,"Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires .",adventure
1667,"Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .",adventure
1668,No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action .,adventure
1669,"The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .",adventure
1670,"From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .",adventure
1671,"Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .",adventure
1672,"After their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` Hoe-Down '' .",adventure
1673,"Only , they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration .",adventure
1674,"But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle , and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting `` Glory Be '' and `` Hallelujah '' above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration .",adventure
1675,"`` Nor Methodists , neither '' , she replied .",adventure
1676,"`` Not that it matters to me , being this far along '' .",adventure
1677,"`` Come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal '' .",adventure
1678,"Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` I ain't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell , but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles '' .",adventure
1679,"With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally .",adventure
1680,"And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell '' .",adventure
1681,"At the sight of Sally's happy face and carefree expression , Harmony's dark , brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears .",adventure
1682,"She was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan .",adventure
1683,And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod .,adventure
1684,"But she couldn't , not yet .",adventure
1685,"Out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` The farmer choose his wife '' .",adventure
1686,"With a swift swoop of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit '' .",adventure
1687,"Soon the child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle .",adventure
1688,"By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them .",adventure
1689,Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness .,adventure
1690,"Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains .",adventure
1691,Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .,adventure
1692,"No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep .",adventure
1693,"For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night .",adventure
1694,"Next morning , they moved on again .",adventure
1695,"Gran Harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load .",adventure
1696,Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins .,adventure
1697,`` How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising '' ? ?,adventure
1698,"`` Quit ragging him , Gran '' , Rod protested .",adventure
1699,`` I ain't ragging him '' ! !,adventure
1700,"`` But honest-to-Betsy , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon '' .",adventure
1701,"The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice .",adventure
1702,"`` Rheumatics worse , Pa '' ? ?",adventure
1703,"Dan asked Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends .",adventure
1704,"`` My right leg's stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied .",adventure
1705,`` But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling '' .,adventure
1706,"Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , `` Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar '' .",adventure
1707,"`` Wonder what made them hurry so '' , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink .",adventure
1708,"Dan grinned , and changed the subject .",adventure
1709,"`` From now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit '' .",adventure
1710,"`` Ain't no sense you eating our dust '' , Rod protested .",adventure
1711,"`` Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained .",adventure
1712,"`` Jackson recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up .",adventure
1713,He's got the tightest running gear in the train now .,adventure
1714,"Besides , 'tain't no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch '' .",adventure
1715,"`` Reckon ye're right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder .",adventure
1716,`` I'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon '' .,adventure
1717,"`` We'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , Harmony '' , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth .",adventure
1718,`` Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown '' .,adventure
1719,"Out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn .",adventure
1720,"While no larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous .",adventure
1721,Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about .,adventure
1722,"Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them .",adventure
1723,"`` Gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here at all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs .",adventure
1724,"There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado , not counting the lower class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters .",adventure
1725,Pat only nodded .,adventure
1726,"`` Take one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed .",adventure
1727,`` If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in '' .,adventure
1728,Cobb's assent was tight .,adventure
1729,`` You do the same .,adventure
1730,"It's all I ask , Stevens '' .",adventure
1731,Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .,adventure
1732,"Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief .",adventure
1733,"He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street .",adventure
1734,"The Palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch .",adventure
1735,Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .,adventure
1736,Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .,adventure
1737,"Nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits .",adventure
1738,"Against all expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him .",adventure
1739,He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot .,adventure
1740,"Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below .",adventure
1741,Stevens was nowhere in sight .,adventure
1742,"Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down .",adventure
1743,"As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared .",adventure
1744,"`` What luck , Cobb '' ? ?",adventure
1745,He said swiftly .,adventure
1746,Russ pointed upward .,adventure
1747,"`` He's there '' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement .",adventure
1748,"Hitching his cartridge belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side .",adventure
1749,"Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door .",adventure
1750,Pat pushed through first .,adventure
1751,"Forced behind him momentarily , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside .",adventure
1752,His eyes widened .,adventure
1753,"While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday .",adventure
1754,Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen .,adventure
1755,"A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables .",adventure
1756,"Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass .",adventure
1757,"Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately .",adventure
1758,The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .,adventure
1759,"A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell .",adventure
1760,Pat moved into it .,adventure
1761,"Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side .",adventure
1762,The door was locked .,adventure
1763,"Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward , a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike .",adventure
1764,Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .,adventure
1765,With a bellow Carmer lunged at him .,adventure
1766,"But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled .",adventure
1767,Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan .,adventure
1768,"He started to struggle up , heaving desperately .",adventure
1769,"Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned .",adventure
1770,"`` Okay , Stevens .",adventure
1771,"I've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped .",adventure
1772,"`` Go through his pockets , will you ? ?",adventure
1773,If we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of '' ! !,adventure
1774,"Complying methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing .",adventure
1775,"Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell .",adventure
1776,`` Look at this '' ! !,adventure
1777,"`` By golly , Stevens ! !",adventure
1778,"You were right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat .",adventure
1779,`` Where else would he get it ? ?,adventure
1780,"Count what you've got there , Cobb .",adventure
1781,We can soon tell '' .,adventure
1782,Pat nodded .,adventure
1783,"`` It's within a hundred of what Crip had '' , he declared .",adventure
1784,`` We know Penny spent some -- and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on '' .,adventure
1785,"Handing the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean .",adventure
1786,His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .,adventure
1787,`` Shall we get out of here '' ? ?,adventure
1788,"Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come .",adventure
1789,"Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out .",adventure
1790,He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .,adventure
1791,Neither spoke till they reached their horses .,adventure
1792,"Pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow .",adventure
1793,"It'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it , Russ '' .",adventure
1794,To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .,adventure
1795,I've had enough .,adventure
1796,"It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens '' , he pursued strictly .",adventure
1797,`` Whatever you say '' .,adventure
1798,"Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .",adventure
1799,"`` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly .",adventure
1800,"`` Old Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly .",adventure
1801,`` He'll know when you tell him .,adventure
1802,`` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs .,adventure
1803,"`` But I still think Penny's an awful nice girl , Russ '' --",adventure
1804,"Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street .",adventure
1805,"Pat let him go , following more leisurely .",adventure
1806,"`` Penny's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly .",adventure
1807,"Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events .",adventure
1808,`` Gyp Carmer couldn't have known about Colcord's money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him '' ? ?,adventure
1809,He asked himself .,adventure
1810,How much of an accident could that be '' ? ?,adventure
1811,"Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .",adventure
1812,In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ;,adventure
1813,"Hauling up , Russ listened carefully .",adventure
1814,What did it mean ? ?,adventure
1815,"Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm .",adventure
1816,His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing .,adventure
1817,"Setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face .",adventure
1818,"When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression .",adventure
1819,He knew now what he was up against .,adventure
1820,"Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly .",adventure
1821,"If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later .",adventure
1822,A harsh cry floated to him across the brush .,adventure
1823,"A carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side .",adventure
1824,The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .,adventure
1825,"Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily .",adventure
1826,Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .,adventure
1827,"Leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range .",adventure
1828,"Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw .",adventure
1829,He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .,adventure
1830,"He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot .",adventure
1831,A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot .,adventure
1832,A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away .,adventure
1833,"A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm .",adventure
1834,Another snarled close overhead .,adventure
1835,`` Jumping Jerusalem ! !,adventure
1836,Let's get out of here '' ! !,adventure
1837,The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .,adventure
1838,"Sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment .",adventure
1839,"He heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words .",adventure
1840,"He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it .",adventure
1841,"Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range .",adventure
1842,Yet he must chance it .,adventure
1843,"He clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about .",adventure
1844,Every plane that could fly was sent into the air .,adventure
1845,Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .,adventure
1846,"Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships .",adventure
1847,"Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte .",adventure
1848,No one had much to say .,adventure
1849,The sky glowered down at them .,adventure
1850,Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .,adventure
1851,His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .,adventure
1852,Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .,adventure
1853,"`` I've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders .",adventure
1854,It's for carabao not airplanes '' .,adventure
1855,`` We'll make out .,adventure
1856,"Don't you worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it .",adventure
1857,`` Yeah .,adventure
1858,"The expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return .",adventure
1859,"At the prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out .",adventure
1860,"From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip .",adventure
1861,"Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him .",adventure
1862,The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful .,adventure
1863,The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small .,adventure
1864,"The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan .",adventure
1865,"Greg's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again .",adventure
1866,"To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes .",adventure
1867,Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers .,adventure
1868,The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .,adventure
1869,The overcast was solid above him .,adventure
1870,As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it .,adventure
1871,They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned .,adventure
1872,Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .,adventure
1873,"`` Todman , let's try to go under this stuff .",adventure
1874,Stay in close and we'll go up the valley '' .,adventure
1875,"`` Roger , Sweeney '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg .",adventure
1876,The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn .,adventure
1877,"It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia .",adventure
1878,"The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in .",adventure
1879,"If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .",adventure
1880,"When the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out .",adventure
1881,He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast .,adventure
1882,Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .,adventure
1883,`` Somebody beat us to it '' ! !,adventure
1884,Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation .,adventure
1885,It was frustrating .,adventure
1886,His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights .,adventure
1887,He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill .,adventure
1888,But Greg's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn .,adventure
1889,"Finally , as time began to run out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies .",adventure
1890,The low clouds made bombing difficult .,adventure
1891,There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .,adventure
1892,Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .,adventure
1893,"With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily .",adventure
1894,Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .,adventure
1895,"Mercifully , it was still open .",adventure
1896,"Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .",adventure
1897,He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in : `` Sweeneys ! !,adventure
1898,Three bogies .,adventure
1899,Twelve o'clock level '' .,adventure
1900,Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .,adventure
1901,"He saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast .",adventure
1902,Friend or enemy ? ?,adventure
1903,The same old question .,adventure
1904,And only a few seconds to answer it .,adventure
1905,`` Zeros '' ! !,adventure
1906,"Todman said excitedly , and hopefully .",adventure
1907,His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification .,adventure
1908,He narrowed the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft .,adventure
1909,"Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower .",adventure
1910,"His present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages .",adventure
1911,"But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already .",adventure
1912,But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .,adventure
1913,He pushed the radio button .,adventure
1914,"`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck .",adventure
1915,Lots of throttle .,adventure
1916,"Todman , you take the one on the left .",adventure
1917,"Belton , the one on the right .",adventure
1918,If they're Japs .,adventure
1919,Let's make sure first '' .,adventure
1920,Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` Rogers '' .,adventure
1921,"The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully .",adventure
1922,The opposing aircraft continued to come on .,adventure
1923,They appeared to be the enemy .,adventure
1924,Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes .,adventure
1925,"There was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them .",adventure
1926,It was a box .,adventure
1927,Greg pushed the radio button again .,adventure
1928,"`` Todman , drop your second element back .",adventure
1929,"If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces .",adventure
1930,"Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy .",adventure
1931,"The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom .",adventure
1932,The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him .,adventure
1933,His hands shook .,adventure
1934,`` They're Japs .,adventure
1935,"They're Japs '' , came a high-pitched voice .",adventure
1936,`` Greg to Sweeney Blue .,adventure
1937,One pass only .,adventure
1938,No turns .,adventure
1939,You'll bust your ass in this canyon .,adventure
1940,He moved the flights over against one wall .,adventure
1941,It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery .,adventure
1942,"If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out .",adventure
1943,"A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done .",adventure
1944,"Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting .",adventure
1945,The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .,adventure
1946,"`` They haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .",adventure
1947,He hit the radio button .,adventure
1948,Let's take 'em home '' .,adventure
1949,He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag .,adventure
1950,"Out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him .",adventure
1951,"Perfect , he thought .",adventure
1952,"With the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done .",adventure
1953,Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board .,adventure
1954,He tightened his turn .,adventure
1955,It was going to be dangerous .,adventure
1956,Eight aircraft in this small box .,adventure
1957,"Please , dear God , make my pilots good , he prayed .",adventure
1958,"He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another .",adventure
1959,The enemy did not veer .,adventure
1960,It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted .,adventure
1961,Blind fools .,adventure
1962,Now ! !,adventure
1963,The plane rumbled and slowed .,adventure
1964,As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .,adventure
1965,Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .,adventure
1966,The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces .,adventure
1967,It was all Greg had time to see .,adventure
1968,"If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground .",adventure
1969,"Wingman , stay clear , he prayed .",adventure
1970,He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .,adventure
1971,He fought the panic of vertigo .,adventure
1972,His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .,adventure
1973,"Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat .",adventure
1974,"`` Moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced .",adventure
1975,"We were coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop .",adventure
1976,"Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : Moriarty , New Mexico .",adventure
1977,`` Gracias .,adventure
1978,"Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters .",adventure
1979,I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass .,adventure
1980,gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .,adventure
1981,White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .,adventure
1982,"Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , I saw emergent in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the leering face of old Herry .",adventure
1983,"`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde .",adventure
1984,"Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where -- hidden -- more delicately-textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes .",adventure
1985,Damn his luck .,adventure
1986,"I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and -- Well , at least I wouldn't have shouted back a taunt .",adventure
1987,"Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me .",adventure
1988,It was stopping .,adventure
1989,"Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag , I heard : `` Sahjunt Yoorick , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck '' .",adventure
1990,"The voice was that of Johnson , tail gunner off another crew .",adventure
1991,Squeezing a look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` Y'all drahve '' ? ?,adventure
1992,"`` Ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe , an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt .",adventure
1993,But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im '' .,adventure
1994,"I said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew .",adventure
1995,How far I knew will shortly become apparent .,adventure
1996,Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit '' ( 35 m.p.h. ) `` is still in ee-faket '' .,adventure
1997,"When Johnson ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma'am '' ? ?",adventure
1998,"Mrs. Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs '' .",adventure
1999,Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age .,adventure
2000,"Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it .",adventure

2095,"She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough .",adventure
2096,"There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before .",adventure

2128,"Zing was the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in zing ! !",adventure
2129,", Inc. .",adventure
2130,"They'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit .",adventure
2131,"Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping , the A.M.A. , and the Veterinary Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you didn't bathe .",adventure
2132,"My lovely caller -- Joyce Holland was her name -- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor .",adventure
2133,"The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .",adventure
2134,even to clean men and boys .,adventure
2135,"Joyce went on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer .",adventure
2136,"He wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said .",adventure
2137,"Everybody left and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too .",adventure
2138,And he didn't have any clothes on '' .,adventure
2139,`` He didn't '' ! !,adventure
2140,"`` Yes , he didn't .",adventure
2141,"Did , I mean '' .",adventure
2142,"`` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on .",adventure

2144,"`` You got away , didn't you '' ? ?",adventure
2145,`` Yes .,adventure
2146,`` I didn't know .,adventure
2147,I wouldn't have the stuff in the house .,adventure
2148,But I'm pleased to hear '' --,adventure
2149,`` So I just scooted out of his clutches .,adventure
2150,"The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed '' .",adventure
2151,"She'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool .",adventure
2152,"While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge .",adventure
2153,She went on :,adventure
2154,"`` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up .",adventure
2155,"Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead .",adventure
2156,"The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana .",adventure
2157,There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive .,adventure
2158,"I was so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here '' .",adventure
2159,"What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification .",adventure
2160,"She realized I'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name .",adventure
2161,Or at least not to Joyce .,adventure
2162,"`` And I so want the part '' , she said .",adventure
2163,"`` The commercials have just been for money , there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater Western Eye I'd have a chance to act .",adventure
2164,I could show what I can do '' .,adventure
2165,"As far as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .",adventure
2166,"But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .",adventure
2167,"Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom .",adventure
2168,Joyce squirmed a little on the divan .,adventure
2169,"`` I'm starting to itch '' , she said .",adventure
2170,`` Itch '' ? ?,adventure
2171,"`` Yes , I'm still all covered with that soap .",adventure
2172,"I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off .",adventure
2173,"Mmmm , it sure itches '' .",adventure
2174,"`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' .",adventure
2175,"`` Oh , I'd love to '' .",adventure
2176,"I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .",adventure
2177,That always relaxes me .,adventure
2178,Doesn't it you '' ? ?,adventure
2179,`` Only when I do it '' .,adventure
2180,I shook my head .,adventure
2181,One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .,adventure
2182,"`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce .",adventure
2183,"So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone ''",adventure
2184,I looked at my watch .,adventure
2185,Ten after nine .,adventure
2186,"Time to go , I supposed .",adventure
2187,"`` Well , goodbye '' , I said .",adventure
2188,`` Goodbye .,adventure
2189,You'd better hurry '' .,adventure
2190,"`` Oh , you can count on that '' .",adventure
2191,She smiled slightly .,adventure
2192,Softly .,adventure
2193,Warmly .,adventure
2194,`` Don't hurry too much .,adventure
2195,I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .,adventure
2196,But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .,adventure
2197,"However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think .",adventure
2198,I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .,adventure
2199,"As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .",adventure
2200,She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .,adventure
2201,"Hell , she couldn't .",adventure
2202,"Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .",adventure
2203,"But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected .",adventure
2204,Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .,adventure
2205,I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .,adventure
2206,"Two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .",adventure
2207,"At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather .",adventure
2208,`` How'd you hear about this one '' ? ?,adventure
2209,Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years .,adventure
2210,"A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now .",adventure
2211,"Present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been Thor's partner Bill Blake , and Antony Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account .",adventure
2212,"Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .",adventure
2213,I asked Rawlins .,adventure
2214,"`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff '' .",adventure
2215,What is the gunk '' ? ?,adventure
2216,`` How would I know ? ?,adventure
2217,It's a secret .,adventure
2218,That was the new advertising angle -- something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient .,adventure
2219,"Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' -- He stopped and looked at Thor's body .",adventure
2220,"I said , `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows .",adventure
2221,"How's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? ?",adventure
2222,`` Can't say yet .,adventure
2223,Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em .,adventure
2224,"Accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' .",adventure
2225,`` I'll pick murder .,adventure
2226,Anything else '' ? ?,adventure
2227,"`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out .",adventure
2228,Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ;,adventure
2229,"If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ;",adventure
2230,those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .,adventure
2231,"I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter .",adventure
2232,The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day .,adventure
2233,"I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .",adventure
2234,When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted .,adventure
2235,"I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ;",adventure
2236,"and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner .",adventure
2237,The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .,adventure
2238,My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .,adventure
2239,"Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything .",adventure
2240,One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .,adventure
2241,"They were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .",adventure
2242,She looked more like twenty-five or six .,adventure
2243,My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex .,adventure
2244,"There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .",adventure
2245,"Her legs were the full , sexy kind , full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite ; ;",adventure
2246,"the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect .",adventure
2247,"The true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body .",adventure
2248,"The artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .",adventure
2249,And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .,adventure
2250,That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;,adventure
2251,I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .,adventure
2252,I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks .,adventure
2253,She was standing with her back to the glass door .,adventure
2254,"Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .",adventure
2255,"Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance .",adventure
2256,When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it .,adventure
2257,"And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously .",adventure
2258,I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .,adventure
2259,I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .,adventure
2260,"When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of `` Me , too '' .",adventure
2261,You have probably experienced this .,adventure
2262,It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity .,adventure
2263,I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me .,adventure
2264,"He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living .",adventure
2265,"Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;",adventure
2266,or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ;,adventure
2267,some women with father fixations do .,adventure
2268,"For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; ;",adventure
2269,his bride opened the store .,adventure
2270,I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition .,adventure
2271,"Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .",adventure
2272,"The cavernous depth , cluttered with antiques , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk .",adventure
2273,"She placed her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next '' ? ?",adventure
2274,I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune .,adventure
2275,"I was standing beside her , watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped .",adventure
2276,"I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush .",adventure
2277,"Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender .",adventure
2278,It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .,adventure
2279,`` He will not always be indisposed '' .,adventure
2280,`` I know .,adventure
2281,How will we work it out '' ? ?,adventure
2282,"`` I don't know '' , she said .",adventure
2283,`` You're the man .,adventure
2284,You figure it out .,adventure
2285,I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' .,adventure
2286,`` I guess we both felt it '' .,adventure
2287,"`` I guess so '' , she said .",adventure
2288,`` But now what '' ? ?,adventure
2289,Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable .,adventure
2290,"`` I know what we can do '' , I said .",adventure
2291,`` Tell him I made a pass at you '' .,adventure
2292,She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .,adventure
2293,Get thrown out ? ?,adventure
2294,If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? ?,adventure
2295,`` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will .,adventure
2296,I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us '' .,adventure
2297,`` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ?,adventure
2298,She said incredulously .,adventure
2299,"`` When I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class .",adventure
2300,I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets .,adventure
2301,In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; ;,adventure
2302,and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .,adventure
2303,Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially .,adventure
2304,"A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball .",adventure
2305,There will be romance and flirtation .,adventure
2306,"If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am .",adventure
2307,We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain .,adventure
2308,And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .,adventure
2309,You are both the same size .,adventure
2310,He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .,adventure
2311,When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' .,adventure
2312,`` But you '' -- she began .,adventure
2313,`` Don't worry about me .,adventure
2314,It will turn out all right '' .,adventure
2315,"`` I don't understand '' , she insisted .",adventure
2316,`` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ?,adventure
2317,"`` No '' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' .",adventure
2318,"As we expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning .",adventure
2319,"I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife .",adventure
2320,I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .,adventure
2321,I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .,adventure
2322,Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .,adventure
2323,A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner .,adventure
2324,If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him .,adventure
2325,In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .,adventure
2326,I suspected why he brought it along .,adventure
2327,`` You cheap bitch '' ! !,adventure
2328,"`` You cheap , no good , two-timing bitch ! !",adventure
2329,-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! !,adventure
2330,You should -- smack ! !,adventure
2331,-- be ashamed of yourself .,adventure
2332,He had better write a postcard to Walter .,adventure
2333,"The code , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use .",adventure
2334,"A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something .",adventure
2335,"Nicolas called on his muse , a line came back :",adventure
2336,"`` Squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts '' .",adventure
2337,"That ought to draw a laugh , Nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind .",adventure
2338,"Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table .",adventure
2339,Dammit ! !,adventure
2340,His hand was large and square and heavily tanned .,adventure
2341,The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt .,adventure
2342,His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months .,adventure
2343,He had returned to the pension a week ago .,adventure
2344,He was determined to spend an industrious summer .,adventure
2345,"Or , more rhythmically , ' The swarthy witches are laughing ' ? ?",adventure
2346,"But Nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning .",adventure
2347,Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ;,adventure
2348,but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him .,adventure
2349,Should she wake him ? ?,adventure
2350,"Her heart , her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from Poussin .",adventure
2351,She was just not able to break the spell .,adventure
2352,( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars ? ?,adventure
2353,"Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?",adventure
2354,"So if all these beers was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' .",adventure
2355,"To this meek conjugation Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket .",adventure
2356,"And , as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew .",adventure
2357,He used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions .,adventure
2358,Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this .,adventure
2359,") Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes .",adventure
2360,She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .,adventure
2361,"This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised .",adventure
2362,That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes .,adventure
2363,"His advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair -- this was all new .",adventure
2364,"Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith .",adventure
2365,The next day he was gone .,adventure
2366,"Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined .",adventure
2367,She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens .,adventure
2368,"`` Dear girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens '' .",adventure
2369,`` How like him '' ! !,adventure
2370,Mary Jane had smilingly said .,adventure
2371,"`` His address '' , Walter added , `` is that great foundling home , the American Express .",adventure
2372,And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband .,adventure
2373,"'' For the last half hour Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the Gardens and , at last , come upon her knight .",adventure
2374,She set down her suitcase .,adventure
2375,Should she wake him ? ?,adventure
2376,The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .,adventure
2377,Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car .,adventure
2378,He began sweating .,adventure
2379,"In his dream he cried , `` Slow down , for Chrissake '' ! !",adventure
2380,He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass .,adventure
2381,His nose was tickled .,adventure
2382,He sneezed .,adventure
2383,He blew his nose expertly between his fingers .,adventure
2384,He spit .,adventure
2385,"He half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs .",adventure
2386,"He belched , he stretched .",adventure
2387,"Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away .",adventure
2388,Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities .,adventure
2389,"The Grafin , who was charmed by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair .",adventure
2390,Families are very interesting .,adventure
2391,But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once .,adventure
2392,And then we shall see .,adventure
2393,'' ( The Grafin was partial to the word shall .,adventure
2394,),adventure
2395,"Meredith was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty ! !",adventure
2396,Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?,adventure
2397,"Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe .",adventure
2398,You shall see her at dinner '' .,adventure
2399,Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running ; ;,adventure
2400,"when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way .",adventure
2401,"Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .",adventure
2402,"Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan .",adventure
2403,"He flexed his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed .",adventure
2404,"It would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he , oh , dropped his napkin , so startled was he by Mary Jane's beauty .",adventure
2405,"Yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here , indeed , was something special .",adventure
2406,Mary Jane had made very little effort .,adventure
2407,"Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with , as he soon perceived , no brassiere beneath .",adventure
2408,Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders .,adventure
2409,"She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual .",adventure
2410,The result was grace and modesty .,adventure
2411,"As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control .",adventure
2412,Meredith began falling in love .,adventure
2413,Soup : `` Only this morning '' ; ;,adventure
2414,Wine : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? ?,adventure
2415,; ;,adventure
2416,a smile .,adventure
2417,Like as if it were built of books '' .,adventure
2418,"Having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin .",adventure
2419,Opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it .,adventure
2420,`` I think the maids tipple in the afternoon '' .,adventure
2421,`` Those sweet girls ? ?,adventure
2422,Oh you're joking .,adventure
2423,It tastes a little like poppyseed .,adventure
2424,What's its name ? ?,adventure
2425,"Steinhager '' She whispered Steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it .",adventure
2426,`` Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? ?,adventure
2427,"in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. , Poetry Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .",adventure
2428,"His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .",adventure
2429,"The husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite , Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ?",adventure
2430,"In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' .",adventure
2431,"Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words .",adventure
2432,I can never pronounce it '' .,adventure
2433,She repeated `` Eurydice '' .,adventure
2434,But with her hand poem again .,adventure
2435,"She raised her face and nodded , `` It's sweet , and very sad '' .",adventure
2436,They finished the small bottle of Steinhager .,adventure
2437,"She confessed she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ?",adventure
2438,They smiled .,adventure
2439,"At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' .",adventure
2440,"Kissing her he whispered , several times , `` Eurydice '' .",adventure
2441,The third time rather urgently .,adventure
2442,"But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , expectant , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth .",adventure
2443,"They were west of the Sabine , but only God knew where .",adventure
2444,"For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea .",adventure
2445,suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ;,adventure
2446,"He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .",adventure
2447,He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .,adventure
2448,He spat .,adventure
2449,The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton .,adventure
2450,The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches .,adventure
2451,He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .,adventure
2452,The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste .,adventure
2453,But it was water .,adventure
2454,"Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !",adventure
2455,He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .,adventure
2456,He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .,adventure
2457,"She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .",adventure
2458,She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face .,adventure
2459,"She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .",adventure
2460,`` What happens when there's no more water '' ? ?,adventure
2461,She asked smolderingly .,adventure
2462,Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .,adventure
2463,Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .,adventure
2464,"And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly .",adventure
2465,"A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .",adventure
2466,`` There must be some water under there '' .,adventure
2467,He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .,adventure
2468,"`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .",adventure
2469,`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?,adventure
2470,She scoffed .,adventure
2471,"`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? ?",adventure
2472,"`` We can boil it '' , he said .",adventure
2473,"`` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely .",adventure
2474,`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now .,adventure
2475,They'll roll off in another day .,adventure
2476,There was no valley like this on your map .,adventure
2477,You don't even know where we're headed '' .,adventure
2478,"`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west .",adventure
2479,"Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' .",adventure
2480,`` Somewhere ! !,adventure
2481,'' She repeated .,adventure
2482,`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .,adventure
2483,His wide mouth compressed .,adventure
2484,"In a way , he couldn't blame her .",adventure
2485,"It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .",adventure
2486,It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .,adventure
2487,"Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him .",adventure
2488,"It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .",adventure
2489,The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .,adventure
2490,She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .,adventure
2491,"But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .",adventure
2492,"He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands .",adventure
2493,`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !,adventure
2494,Her laugh was hard .,adventure
2495,`` They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around '' .,adventure
2496,He winced .,adventure
2497,"`` Hettie , they didn't sell you '' , he said miserably .",adventure
2498,"`` They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own .",adventure
2499,They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them .,adventure
2500,"Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge '' ? ?",adventure
2501,He darkened under his heavy burn .,adventure
2502,His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .,adventure
2503,"To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .",adventure
2504,"The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .",adventure
2505,"Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills .",adventure
2506,"He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina .",adventure
2507,"He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! !",adventure
2508,And goaded the oxen as he yelled .,adventure
2509,"He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm .",adventure
2510,"Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .",adventure
2511,He swung up over the wheel .,adventure
2512,"`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .",adventure
2513,But she sat on in stubborn silence .,adventure
2514,The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .,adventure
2515,"Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones .",adventure
2516,The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .,adventure
2517,Their world turned black .,adventure
2518,"The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .",adventure
2519,"And then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket .",adventure
2520,Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .,adventure
2521,"Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks .",adventure
2522,"The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff .",adventure
2523,The cloudburst cut off abruptly .,adventure
2524,"They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river .",adventure
2525,"Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .",adventure
2526,"Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills .",adventure
2527,The water level was higher than their hubs .,adventure
2528,Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .,adventure
2529,"There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .",adventure
2530,"The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling .",adventure
2531,Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben .,adventure
2532,"At least , the wheels dug in .",adventure
2533,"The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .",adventure
2534,His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .,adventure
2535,She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .,adventure
2536,Somebody was riding the tree .,adventure
2537,"It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch .",adventure
2538,She did not call out .,adventure
2539,"But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell .",adventure
2540,They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .,adventure
2541,The pale blob of the woman disappeared .,adventure
2542,The girl murmured harshly .,adventure
2543,"Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his .",adventure
2544,"It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man .",adventure
2545,He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .,adventure
2546,He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward .,adventure
2547,They were already swollen to bursting .,adventure
2548,"Of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured .",adventure
2549,The oxen might as well enjoy it .,adventure
2550,He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .,adventure
2551,"He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley .",adventure
2552,"A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him .",adventure
2553,He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .,adventure
2554,Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .,adventure
2555,Hope surged within him .,adventure
2556,"He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate .",adventure
2557,A tight wagon meant so much .,adventure
2558,He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .,adventure
2559,"He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort .",adventure
2560,Their jams and jellies had not suffered .,adventure
2561,"Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie .",adventure
2562,"His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time .",adventure
2563,"He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .",adventure
2564,"He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures .",adventure
2565,"He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I don't figure your things got wet too much .",adventure
2566,That's a good trunk .,adventure
2567,"She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be streaked '' .",adventure
2568,He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .,adventure
2569,"Sulphur , oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of .",adventure
2570,I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze .,adventure
2571,"Now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do .",adventure
2572,The lifeboats were stuck fast .,adventure
2573,We couldn't budge them .,adventure
2574,I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back .,adventure
2575,He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .,adventure
2576,One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits .,adventure
2577,"Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , Sommers , Max step on it , we got a chance now .",adventure
2578,Heave on those ropes ; ;,adventure
2579,the boat's come unstuck '' .,adventure
2580,"We pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely .",adventure
2581,The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .,adventure
2582,Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water .,adventure
2583,"Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .",adventure
2584,"`` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair .",adventure
2585,`` That tub is going to explode all at once '' .,adventure
2586,"Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke .",adventure
2587,Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water .,adventure
2588,"`` Sommers , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded .",adventure
2589,"Three days previously , we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance .",adventure
2590,"Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon .",adventure
2591,There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ;,adventure
2592,our muscles were hot wires of pain .,adventure
2593,Brassnose was strangely silent .,adventure
2594,"The big man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago .",adventure
2595,He then said something which struck a chord in my memory .,adventure
2596,`` God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga .,adventure
2597,We'd be in real trouble then .,adventure
2598,I'd rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .,adventure
2599,"I was puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies .",adventure
2600,He had been speaking of this archipelago :,adventure
2601,"`` Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 , , Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth .",adventure
2602,I'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! !,adventure
2603,"There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson .",adventure
2604,"Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga .",adventure
2605,"Indeed , you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods .",adventure
2606,"In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' .",adventure
2607,"`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said .",adventure
2608,`` I know something about Eromonga .,adventure
2609,Let's hope we come to a safer place '' .,adventure
2610,But we didn't .,adventure
2611,"Three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view .",adventure
2612,Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs : I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil .,adventure
2613,A half-hour passed ; ;,adventure
2614,we had drifted closer .,adventure
2615,"It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff '' .",adventure
2616,I squinted at the looming shoreline .,adventure
2617,"There was a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump ; ;",adventure
2618,A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .,adventure
2619,He made a sound of despair deep in his throat .,adventure
2620,"It was embarrassing to see strapping , blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen .",adventure
2621,`` Aaa-ee ! !,adventure
2622,"It is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death .",adventure
2623,"It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there .",adventure
2624,"Often , I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul .",adventure
2625,They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers '' .,adventure
2626,"Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .",adventure
2627,But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .,adventure
2628,My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .,adventure
2629,We are thirsty and hungry ; ;,adventure
2630,our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' .,adventure
2631,The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me .,adventure
2632,I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair .,adventure
2633,"She said , `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen .",adventure
2634,You are welcome to Eromonga .,adventure
2635,My people await you on the shore .,adventure
2636,"You shall have food , water and rest '' .",adventure
2637,I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .,adventure
2638,There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick .,adventure
2639,Some had been there for years ; ;,adventure
2640,others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .,adventure
2641,"This was also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face , the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose .",adventure
2642,The body may have been two or three weeks' dead .,adventure
2643,I looked with revulsion at the legs .,adventure
2644,They were shattered .,adventure
2645,Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh .,adventure
2646,"As if divining my thoughts , the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden :",adventure
2647,"`` This is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku .",adventure
2648,Is it not well-made ? ?,adventure
2649,Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago .,adventure
2650,"It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .",adventure
2651,We are very proud of it '' .,adventure
2652,"`` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .",adventure
2653,He looked as if he was going to keel over .,adventure
2654,I felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid .,adventure
2655,"Not so soon , anyway .",adventure
2656,"I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .",adventure
2657,"He speaks your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning .",adventure
2658,The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' .,adventure
2659,This was the worst thing I could have said .,adventure
2660,"Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you're a fool ! !",adventure
2661,They despise males who brag of their strength ; ;,adventure
2662,they destroy such men with their damned tests .,adventure
2663,"You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !",adventure
2664,"At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this .",adventure
2665,But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out .,adventure
2666,The women's faces had hardened after my statement .,adventure
2667,"At a nod from Songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms .",adventure
2668,The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ;,adventure
2669,but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .,adventure
2670,My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face,adventure
2671,.,adventure
2672,"In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed .",adventure
2673,In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases .,adventure
2674,"For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .",adventure
2675,"Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .",adventure
2676,( Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951 .,adventure
2677,),adventure
2678,But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` Karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled .,adventure
2679,Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist .,adventure
2680,"She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death .",adventure
2681,"Within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up .",adventure
2682,`` All men went away from here .,adventure
2683,Those who stayed had to pass tests .,adventure
2684,Few passed '' .,adventure
2685,"She cackled with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth .",adventure
2686,"Come , I show you '' .",adventure
2687,The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .,adventure
2688,In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground .,adventure
2689,"`` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home .",adventure
2690,Maybe to beat up on his squaw '' .,adventure
2691,Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib .,adventure
2692,Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack .,adventure
2693,"`` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' .",adventure
2694,For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened .,adventure
2695,"Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought .",adventure
2696,"Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us .",adventure
2697,"Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .",adventure
2698,"`` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny '' ? ?",adventure
2699,He said to his partner .,adventure
2700,`` You mean dream '' ? ?,adventure
2701,`` Not exactly .,adventure
2702,Just see it '' .,adventure
2703,Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .,adventure
2704,"`` Nope , just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner '' .",adventure
2705,"Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .",adventure
2706,Never Benny .,adventure
2707,Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .,adventure
2708,"With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .",adventure
2709,"Benson said , referring to the Indian .",adventure
2710,"`` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said .",adventure
2711,"`` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said .",adventure
2712,"`` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .",adventure
2713,"A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .",adventure
2714,Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .,adventure
2715,"All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .",adventure
2716,"Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .",adventure
2717,"It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .",adventure
2718,The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .,adventure
2719,He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .,adventure
2720,Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .,adventure
2721,"When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .",adventure
2722,"`` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped .",adventure
2723,She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .,adventure
2724,"Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .",adventure
2725,`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?,adventure
2726,Benson said .,adventure
2727,"Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .",adventure
2728,She might have been someone he had once loved .,adventure
2729,"He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .",adventure
2730,How would you ever see her again ? ?,adventure
2731,`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?,adventure
2732,"Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .",adventure
2733,The girl looked around at the countryside .,adventure
2734,Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .,adventure
2735,It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .,adventure
2736,"She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .",adventure
2737,"What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .",adventure
2738,"The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , Ma'am '' .",adventure
2739,The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .,adventure
2740,The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .,adventure
2741,The two drivers moved closer .,adventure
2742,"`` What does he want , a spoon '' ? ?",adventure
2743,"One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .",adventure
2744,With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember .,adventure
2745,The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .,adventure
2746,"The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .",adventure
2747,The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .,adventure
2748,"He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .",adventure
2749,"He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .",adventure
2750,He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .,adventure
2751,"`` He's dead , isn't he '' ? ?",adventure
2752,The man said .,adventure
2753,He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .,adventure
2754,There was nothing in particular on the man's face .,adventure
2755,"It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .",adventure
2756,`` What's this '' ? ?,adventure
2757,"The man said , backing up a step , still looking down .",adventure
2758,His words were mostly to himself .,adventure
2759,`` Don't '' .,adventure
2760,There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice .,adventure
2761,"Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .",adventure
2762,The man said with a tone of impatience .,adventure
2763,But what is it ? ?,adventure
2764,The man had spoken only once .,adventure
2765,"Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .",adventure
2766,The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg .,adventure
2767,Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .,adventure
2768,"He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , fella .",adventure
2769,Them's brains '' .,adventure
2770,Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .,adventure
2771,"It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ;",adventure
2772,he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin .,adventure
2773,Ramey's fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .,adventure
2774,The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .,adventure
2775,Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .,adventure
2776,"As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .",adventure
2777,He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .,adventure
2778,"With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .",adventure
2779,"His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .",adventure
2780,"After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .",adventure
2781,He moaned and pulled the hand away .,adventure
2782,Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .,adventure
2783,Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .,adventure
2784,`` What happened '' ? ?,adventure
2785,Someone said .,adventure
2786,`` He's hurt '' ! !,adventure
2787,The man on the ground began to move ; ;,adventure
2788,one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .,adventure
2789,The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .,adventure
2790,"`` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ?",adventure
2791,"An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .",adventure
2792,The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .,adventure
2793,None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .,adventure
2794,Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .,adventure
2795,`` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ?,adventure
2796,"She said , her voice rising .",adventure
2797,Ramey said nothing .,adventure
2798,A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .,adventure
2799,Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .,adventure
2800,"Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .",adventure
2801,Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .,adventure
2802,Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .,adventure
2803,"It's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .",adventure
2804,Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .,adventure
2805,"He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .",adventure
2806,"`` All right , step back '' ! !",adventure
2807,The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .,adventure
2808,`` You all right '' ? ?,adventure
2809,"`` Mough -- it's my mough '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .",adventure
2810,His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .,adventure
2811,"He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .",adventure
2812,"He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .",adventure
2813,It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .,adventure
2814,"She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .",adventure
2815,"The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .",adventure
2816,"She's got guts , thought Keith .",adventure
2817,She's got more guts than any other woman in the world .,adventure
2818,"`` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful .",adventure
2819,"I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .",adventure
2820,"Thank you , Keith '' .",adventure
2821,He smiled at her sincerity .,adventure
2822,"And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .",adventure
2823,Strange .,adventure
2824,Seven years they'd been married .,adventure
2825,"He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .",adventure
2826,But her beauty always surprised him anew .,adventure
2827,"`` But knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .",adventure
2828,Isn't that so '' ? ?,adventure
2829,Penny lowered her eyes .,adventure
2830,"`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .",adventure
2831,"`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?",adventure
2832,"Asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .",adventure
2833,"`` It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? ?",adventure
2834,'',adventure
2835,Penny did not answer .,adventure
2836,"`` We're all God's creatures , aren't we '' ? ?",adventure
2837,Keith was snarling now .,adventure
2838,`` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .,adventure
2839,"You love this village and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures , too .",adventure
2840,"And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he's a beautiful man .",adventure
2841,And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman .,adventure
2842,"We're all God's creatures , aren't we , Penny ? ?",adventure
2843,"You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .",adventure
2844,You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake .,adventure
2845,"Well , why don't you say something '' ? ?",adventure
2846,Penny would not rise to his mood .,adventure
2847,"`` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?",adventure
2848,"She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .",adventure
2849,"He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .",adventure
2850,"The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .",adventure
2851,"For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .",adventure
2852,"Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .",adventure
2853,But Keith looked down more than up .,adventure
2854,"At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .",adventure
2855,"Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .",adventure
2856,"And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .",adventure
2857,He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .,adventure
2858,"The RAF was Britain's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .",adventure
2859,He knew how to shoot down Nazis .,adventure
2860,"And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear .",adventure
2861,"That was true , but only half the truth .",adventure
2862,"The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself .",adventure
2863,"Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .",adventure
2864,He enjoyed killing .,adventure
2865,And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .,adventure
2866,"Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .",adventure
2867,Not quite .,adventure
2868,"It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .",adventure
2869,It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .,adventure
2870,"Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .",adventure
2871,They grounded him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices .,adventure
2872,"He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all .",adventure
2873,"Penny knew him better , on her part .",adventure
2874,"He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .",adventure
2875,"They don't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .",adventure
2876,"He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .",adventure
2877,"He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .",adventure
2878,"His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .",adventure
2879,"The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .",adventure
2880,Keith was an eagle .,adventure
2881,Penny and Keith had no romance .,adventure
2882,No dates or hand-holding .,adventure
2883,But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .,adventure
2884,"The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .",adventure
2885,"This time , they had been lucky .",adventure
2886,"The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .",adventure
2887,But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps .,adventure
2888,"There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .",adventure
2889,This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' .,adventure
2890,"The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .",adventure
2891,"There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .",adventure
2892,The bomb was a solitary one .,adventure
2893,"And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .",adventure
2894,"The chaplain married them , on the next day .",adventure
2895,"After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .",adventure
2896,"It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .",adventure
2897,Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .,adventure
2898,"He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .",adventure
2899,He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .,adventure
2900,He couldn't stop killing .,adventure
2901,"That was his true love , not Penny .",adventure
2902,"The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .",adventure
2903,"And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .",adventure
2904,"When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .",adventure
2905,This is a paradise for hunters .,adventure
2906,"This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .",adventure
2907,The great black leopards .,adventure
2908,"The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .",adventure
2909,"He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .",adventure
2910,But there are big rogues in both countries .,adventure
2911,"These were the ones Keith sought out -- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .",adventure
2912,"He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .",adventure
2913,They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .,adventure
2914,"Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .",adventure
2915,"Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .",adventure
2916,"Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .",adventure
2917,"Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; ;",adventure
2918,"and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .",adventure
2919,"He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .",adventure
2920,He was frowning .,adventure
2921,"`` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .",adventure
2922,`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .,adventure
2923,So instead I come up '' .,adventure
2924,`` Was it my equipment '' ? ?,adventure
2925,The German asked .,adventure
2926,`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?,adventure
2927,"`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up .",adventure
2928,He stared stonily at the floor .,adventure
2929,`` I was down to 275 .,adventure
2930,I've been that far half a dozen times .,adventure
2931,I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .,adventure
2932,"`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder .",adventure
2933,`` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .,adventure
2934,And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .,adventure
2935,So you turn around '' .,adventure
2936,"`` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said .",adventure
2937,A note of awe came into his voice .,adventure
2938,I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .,adventure
2939,"`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .",adventure
2940,"But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .",adventure
2941,You don't head back down again .,adventure
2942,"Not me , anyway .",adventure
2943,Not right away '' .,adventure
2944,He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .,adventure
2945,"Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .",adventure
2946,Now he was going to show how much he knew .,adventure
2947,"`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir .",adventure
2948,He ran into the rapture of the depths .,adventure
2949,It makes the diver feel drunk '' .,adventure
2950,"`` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .",adventure
2951,"`` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said .",adventure
2952,"`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on .",adventure
2953,`` It's nothing to fool with .,adventure
2954,It can kill you .,adventure
2955,"Personally , I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' .",adventure
2956,"`` Nobody's giving anything up '' , Robinson said .",adventure
2957,"He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ;",adventure
2958,`` You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ?,adventure
2959,I'm going down again '' .,adventure
2960,Mr. Forsythe exclaimed .,adventure
2961,`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that '' .,adventure
2962,"He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .",adventure
2963,He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony .,adventure
2964,"Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .",adventure
2965,"Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .",adventure
2966,"`` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it .",adventure
2967,I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop .,adventure
2968,"`` Seven years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively .",adventure
2969,"He was thinking , big deal : skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .",adventure
2970,"`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly .",adventure
2971,He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ;,adventure
2972,went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .,adventure
2973,"`` When you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said .",adventure
2974,Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .,adventure
2975,"He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .",adventure
2976,"`` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said .",adventure
2977,`` Can I make you one '' ? ?,adventure
2978,"`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .",adventure
2979,"Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .",adventure
2980,"He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .",adventure
2981,"His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .",adventure
2982,"Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .",adventure
2983,"Aloud he had said , making conversation :",adventure
2984,`` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .,adventure
2985,I like that kid '' .,adventure
2986,"`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?",adventure
2987,"`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .",adventure
2988,`` No '' ? ?,adventure
2989,`` But that's what he told me .,adventure
2990,"Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' .",adventure
2991,"Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .",adventure
2992,`` What do you mean '' ? ?,adventure
2993,"`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .",adventure
2994,`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .,adventure
2995,"Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .",adventure
2996,"I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .",adventure
2997,"Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .",adventure
2998,`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?,adventure
2999,He asked .,adventure
3000,`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .,adventure
3001,"Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .",adventure
3002,He was most eager to make the dive ; ;,adventure
3003,"`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said .",adventure
3004,"There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .",adventure
3005,He started out the door .,adventure
3006,`` One moment '' ! !,adventure
3007,`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?,adventure
3008,`` What else '' ? ?,adventure
3009,Waddell asked .,adventure
3010,"`` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .",adventure
3011,Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .,adventure
3012,Whatever you tell him he will dive .,adventure
3013,I know this from my talks with him '' .,adventure
3014,"`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ?",adventure
3015,Waddell said .,adventure
3016,`` On the basis of the facts '' .,adventure
3017,"`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .",adventure
3018,Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .,adventure
3019,`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .,adventure
3020,I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .,adventure
3021,All tourists come to Florida .,adventure
3022,But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .,adventure
3023,The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .,adventure
3024,It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .,adventure
3025,"`` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said .",adventure
3026,"`` He has the distributorship for Florida , you say '' ? ?",adventure
3027,`` At least for South Florida '' .,adventure
3028,"`` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .",adventure
3029,I guess you're right '' .,adventure
3030,He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .,adventure
3031,"The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ;",adventure
3032,the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .,adventure
3033,"`` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously .",adventure
3034,`` I do not drink so much '' .,adventure
3035,"Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .",adventure
3036,Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .,adventure
3037,He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .,adventure
3038,"`` Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .",adventure
3039,And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;,adventure
3040,crossed himself ; ;,adventure
3041,"said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .",adventure
3042,"Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .",adventure
3043,"`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .",adventure
3044,Make it come off all right .,adventure
3045,"Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .",adventure
3046,And make my life different and better from this time on .,adventure
3047,Amen '' .,adventure
3048,He felt a good deal less shaky .,adventure
3049,"As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .",adventure
3050,Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .,adventure
3051,"`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .",adventure
3052,"`` You came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , Artie said .",adventure
3053,"`` Well , I was a little bit confused .",adventure
3054,"Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter .",adventure
3055,"You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?",adventure
3056,"`` You know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .",adventure
3057,`` I don't think you should go down again '' .,adventure
3058,"The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .",adventure
3059,"As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .",adventure
3060,He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .,adventure
3061,"In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .",adventure
3062,For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .,adventure
3063,"He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .",adventure
3064,His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .,adventure
3065,Yesterday ; ;,adventure
3066,today ; ;,adventure
3067,tomorrow : no surrender .,adventure
3068,His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .,adventure
3069,"He murmured to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender '' .",adventure
3070,It was best to die fighting the marines .,adventure
3071,"His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .",adventure
3072,What if the marines never came ? ?,adventure
3073,His comrades were all dead .,adventure
3074,Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .,adventure
3075,"Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .",adventure
3076,He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .,adventure
3077,His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .,adventure
3078,"The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .",adventure
3079,Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .,adventure
3080,"As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .",adventure
3081,"The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .",adventure
3082,His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .,adventure
3083,"`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .",adventure
3084,The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .,adventure
3085,A signal ? ?,adventure
3086,"Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .",adventure
3087,Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .,adventure
3088,"They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .",adventure
3089,"Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .",adventure
3090,"A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .",adventure
3091,The marines let him advance .,adventure
3092,"When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .",adventure
3093,"The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies .",adventure
3094,Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .,adventure
3095,"At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .",adventure
3096,"Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .",adventure
3097,"He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .",adventure
3098,He strained his hearing .,adventure
3099,faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;,adventure
3100,whispers : he heard none of these .,adventure
3101,Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .,adventure
3102,A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;,adventure
3103,"leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .",adventure
3104,Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .,adventure
3105,"While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .",adventure
3106,"He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .",adventure
3107,The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .,adventure
3108,Hush followed .,adventure
3109,How stupid to give his position away .,adventure
3110,The jungle did not retort .,adventure
3111,The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .,adventure
3112,"Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .",adventure
3113,"Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .",adventure
3114,"Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .",adventure
3115,"He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .",adventure
3116,It ended when he tumbled ; ;,adventure
3117,"He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .",adventure
3118,The pockets of his jacket bulged .,adventure
3119,Hand grenades .,adventure
3120,"In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .",adventure
3121,They could come on him now without difficulty .,adventure
3122,"The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .",adventure
3123,Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .,adventure
3124,"The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .",adventure
3125,Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .,adventure
3126,Reflex ? ?,adventure
3127,"Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .",adventure
3128,"Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .",adventure
3129,"He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .",adventure
3130,"With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .",adventure
3131,The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ;,adventure
3132,"In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding .",adventure
3133,In the other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .,adventure
3134,One by one he tossed the objects aside .,adventure
3135,He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ;,adventure
3136,"he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .",adventure
3137,Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .,adventure
3138,Too bad the marine had no water .,adventure
3139,From its holder he took his own canteen .,adventure
3140,The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .,adventure
3141,"The marine's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .",adventure
3142,"So , alive .",adventure
3143,Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .,adventure
3144,Matsuo shook his head .,adventure
3145,`` None for you '' .,adventure
3146,"The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .",adventure
3147,"Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .",adventure
3148,`` You came well equipped to die '' .,adventure
3149,Some odor made him lean over the man .,adventure
3150,He sniffed and recognized it .,adventure
3151,Sake .,adventure
3152,So that had been his difficulty .,adventure
3153,"Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .",adventure
3154,"The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .",adventure
3155,`` Be a good turtle '' .,adventure
3156,Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .,adventure
3157,The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts .,adventure
3158,"In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .",adventure
3159,"`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?",adventure
3160,"Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows .",adventure
3161,"He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .",adventure
3162,Every so often he turned the knife .,adventure
3163,Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .,adventure
3164,The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .,adventure
3165,Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film .,adventure
3166,The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .,adventure
3167,Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .,adventure
3168,Matsuo shook his head .,adventure
3169,Strange .,adventure
3170,At last he reached for the knife .,adventure
3171,"Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it .",adventure
3172,First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .,adventure
3173,The marine yelled and flung the hand away .,adventure
3174,With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .,adventure
3175,"A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist .",adventure
3176,Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;,adventure
3177,burned the other cheek ; ;,adventure
3178,burned each hand when they came groping again .,adventure
3179,The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .,adventure
3180,Matsuo stood up .,adventure
3181,"`` A small measure of payment , marine '' .",adventure
3182,"He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .",adventure
3183,"The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .",adventure
3184,He ceased weeping .,adventure
3185,The marine was still .,adventure
3186,What now ? ?,adventure
3187,"In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .",adventure
3188,Someone called .,adventure
3189,"It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called .",adventure
3190,Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .,adventure
3191,Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .,adventure
3192,"He aimed , but listened .",adventure
3193,"It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese '' .",adventure
3194,The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .,adventure
3195,"He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .",adventure
3196,`` Sake '' ? ?,adventure
3197,Matsuo called .,adventure
3198,The marine nodded vigorously .,adventure
3199,"Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .",adventure
3200,The marine was a winehead .,adventure
3201,The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .,adventure
3202,One swallow was all he would have ; ;,adventure
3203,"he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .",adventure
3204,His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .,adventure
3205,"Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .",adventure
3206,Of course it was water he really craved ; ;,adventure
3207,down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .,adventure
3208,The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .,adventure
3209,Matsuo shook his head .,adventure
3210,He had no water for an enemy .,adventure
3211,"And when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .",adventure
3212,He capped the bottle and replaced it .,adventure
3213,"After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .",adventure
3214,His head slumped .,adventure
3215,`` Marine .,adventure
3216,"There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said .",adventure
3217,"`` Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .",adventure
3218,I've nothing for you '' .,adventure
3219,He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .,adventure
3220,Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .,adventure
3221,Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .,adventure
3222,"Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .",adventure
3223,He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .,adventure
3224,"`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?",adventure
3225,He asked .,adventure
3226,`` Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that '' .,adventure
3227,"He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .",adventure
3228,"`` Stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called .",adventure
3229,`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' :,adventure
3230,The stranger ignored him .,adventure
3231,He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .,adventure
3232,"`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .",adventure
3233,"`` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?",adventure
3234,`` Because I'm asking .,adventure
3235,Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .,adventure
3236,"`` The kid has no manners , boys .",adventure
3237,Shall we teach him some '' ? ?,adventure
3238,"His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .",adventure
3239,Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .,adventure
3240,"His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .",adventure
3241,"Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .",adventure
3242,A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting .,adventure
3243,"Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .",adventure
3244,"The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .",adventure
3245,"Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? ?",adventure
3246,"`` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet .",adventure
3247,And I aim to have it '' .,adventure
3248,"He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .",adventure
3249,"`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' .",adventure
3250,"`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .",adventure
3251,Somebody brought a light .,adventure
3252,"`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said .",adventure
3253,I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .,adventure
3254,"In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .",adventure
3255,"Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .",adventure
3256,"`` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .",adventure
3257,Blue Throat won't stand for this .,adventure
3258,He'll shoot up the town '' .,adventure
3259,The prediction was correct .,adventure
3260,"The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .",adventure
3261,"`` Amen '' , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' .",adventure
3262,Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .,adventure
3263,"Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .",adventure
3264,"It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .",adventure
3265,He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .,adventure
3266,The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .,adventure
3267,Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .,adventure
3268,"The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store , halfway down the street .",adventure
3269,Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .,adventure
3270,He sized up the situation and shook his head .,adventure
3271,"`` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said .",adventure
3272,He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .,adventure
3273,"`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' .",adventure
3274,Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .,adventure
3275,Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .,adventure
3276,"All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .",adventure
3277,Billy Tilghman did just that .,adventure
3278,"Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .",adventure
3279,It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie .,adventure
3280,Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .,adventure
3281,"To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .",adventure
3282,"Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders .",adventure
3283,"He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him .",adventure
3284,For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .,adventure
3285,"The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .",adventure
3286,"Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .",adventure
3287,He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's .,adventure
3288,"Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .",adventure
3289,"Bill Doolin's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .",adventure
3290,Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .,adventure
3291,"They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .",adventure
3292,"Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .",adventure
3293,"On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch .",adventure
3294,It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .,adventure
3295,"The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .",adventure
3296,The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .,adventure
3297,"`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman .",adventure
3298,`` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .,adventure
3299,"Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .",adventure
3300,There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .,adventure
3301,"Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .",adventure
3302,"Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .",adventure
3303,"`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman .",adventure
3304,The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move .,adventure
3305,Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .,adventure
3306,"Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .",adventure
3307,"And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .",adventure
3308,The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .,adventure
3309,He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .,adventure
3310,The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .,adventure
3311,"`` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .",adventure
3312,`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .,adventure
3313,Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .,adventure
3314,He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .,adventure
3315,"`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely .",adventure
3316,`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .,adventure
3317,All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .,adventure
3318,"`` Well '' , he announced , `` Guess I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup '' .",adventure
3319,"He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .",adventure
3320,He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .,adventure
3321,If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .,adventure
3322,`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry .,adventure
3323,That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .,adventure
3324,Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread .,adventure
3325,"Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .",adventure
3326,"`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .",adventure
3327,`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .,adventure
3328,We'll let him go '' .,adventure
3329,"But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .",adventure
3330,"Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .",adventure
3331,That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .,adventure
3332,"This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ;",adventure
3333,she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .,adventure
3334,"When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .",adventure
3335,Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .,adventure
3336,He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .,adventure
3337,"But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .",adventure
3338,He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ;,adventure
3339,"when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .",adventure
3340,"When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .",adventure
3341,Miss Langford ( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl .,adventure
3342,"Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .",adventure
3343,"Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ;",adventure
3344,"but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .",adventure
3345,"She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .",adventure
3346,"School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .",adventure
3347,The first two or three days they went home early .,adventure
3348,"All , that is , except Jack .",adventure
3349,"He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .",adventure
3350,He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .,adventure
3351,"About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him .",adventure
3352,"He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .",adventure
3353,He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ;,adventure
3354,then he slowed to a walk .,adventure
3355,The vision became even stronger now .,adventure
3356,"`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .",adventure
3357,`` I've got to get her '' .,adventure
3358,"That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .",adventure
3359,"He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .",adventure
3360,"`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?",adventure
3361,"She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .",adventure
3362,`` Aren't you hungry '' ? ?,adventure
3363,"`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .",adventure
3364,"Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .",adventure
3365,He felt a little sick at his stomach .,adventure
3366,`` Are you sick '' ? ?,adventure
3367,"`` No '' , he said .",adventure
3368,`` I'll be all right .,adventure
3369,I guess it's this hot weather '' .,adventure
3370,`` Don't you play hard today then .,adventure
3371,"And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .",adventure
3372,"`` OK. , I won't play hard '' , he promised .",adventure
3373,"Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder .",adventure
3374,"`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?",adventure
3375,"Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .",adventure
3376,"Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes .",adventure
3377,`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?,adventure
3378,"Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .",adventure
3379,"Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles' only apparent interest .",adventure
3380,"But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .",adventure
3381,`` No .,adventure
3382,What '' ? ?,adventure
3383,`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' .,adventure
3384,A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .,adventure
3385,His heart beat faster .,adventure
3386,`` Hell you say '' ? ?,adventure
3387,"He said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .",adventure
3388,`` How'd you do it '' ? ?,adventure
3389,"`` Hell , I jist got on top of -- ''",adventure
3390,"`` Hell , I jist ask her '' .",adventure
3391,"She's been hangin' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well's try it .",adventure
3392,Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it '' .,adventure
3393,`` I never heard that '' .,adventure
3394,`` It's all over Branchville .,adventure
3395,If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself '' .,adventure
3396,"`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .",adventure
3397,"When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse .",adventure
3398,"Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .",adventure
3399,"`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .",adventure
3400,"`` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .",adventure
3401,"`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .",adventure
3402,`` Maybe at dinner time .,adventure
3403,Come inside now '' .,adventure
3404,The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .,adventure
3405,Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .,adventure
3406,He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .,adventure
3407,"Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .",adventure
3408,"At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .",adventure
3409,`` Why ain't you playin' ball '' ? ?,adventure
3410,"He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .",adventure
3411,"`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .",adventure
3412,`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .,adventure
3413,"`` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .",adventure
3414,Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .,adventure
3415,"`` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .",adventure
3416,"`` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .",adventure
3417,"Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .",adventure
3418,"While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I'm sorry , Miss Langford .",adventure
3419,I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .,adventure
3420,"`` That's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .",adventure
3421,With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other .,adventure
3422,"When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .",adventure
3423,He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .,adventure
3424,"`` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off .",adventure
3425,One of the little girls said .,adventure
3426,`` No more today .,adventure
3427,Maybe some other day '' .,adventure
3428,"`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said .",adventure
3429,`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .,adventure
3430,"`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .",adventure
3431,"That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .",adventure
3432,"He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .",adventure
3433,"The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .",adventure
3434,"`` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately .",adventure
3435,To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .,adventure
3436,"`` All right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .",adventure
3437,"And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .",adventure
3438,On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .,adventure
3439,"She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .",adventure
3440,"The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier .",adventure
3441,It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' .,adventure
3442,He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .,adventure
3443,The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .,adventure
3444,"He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .",adventure
3445,"The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .",adventure
3446,The dance was of Haitian origin .,adventure
3447,"The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .",adventure
3448,"He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .",adventure
3449,Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .,adventure
3450,She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses .,adventure
3451,"Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .",adventure
3452,Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .,adventure
3453,"The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .",adventure
3454,He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .,adventure
3455,"Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .",adventure
3456,This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .,adventure
3457,The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .,adventure
3458,"`` What is your name , boy ? ?",adventure
3459,Come a bit closer .,adventure
3460,"I won't bite , you know '' .",adventure
3461,Then he smiled shyly .,adventure
3462,"`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .",adventure
3463,I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .,adventure
3464,Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .,adventure
3465,"Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .",adventure
3466,The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .,adventure
3467,"Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .",adventure
3468,"Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .",adventure
3469,"This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .",adventure
3470,`` Aristide ! !,adventure
3471,I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .,adventure
3472,There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack .,adventure
3473,"If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .",adventure
3474,Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings .,adventure
3475,One less shouldn't matter to him '' .,adventure
3476,"`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?",adventure
3477,"`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?",adventure
3478,"Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .",adventure
3479,It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .,adventure
3480,"`` Be quiet , Devol ! !",adventure
3481,You are forgetting your place '' .,adventure
3482,The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .,adventure
3483,Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .,adventure
3484,He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .,adventure
3485,"Dr. Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .",adventure
3486,He was about 50 years old .,adventure
3487,"`` Another young man , my dear ? ?",adventure
3488,"Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure .",adventure
3489,"Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .",adventure
3490,"`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .",adventure
3491,"I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .",adventure
3492,He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation '' .,adventure
3493,His room will be ready shortly '' .,adventure
3494,The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .,adventure
3495,"Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life .",adventure
3496,But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .,adventure
3497,"Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .",adventure
3498,"Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .",adventure
3499,So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .,adventure
3500,"Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John .",adventure
3501,He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .,adventure
3502,"It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .",adventure
3503,"When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket .",adventure
3504,"Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .",adventure
3505,"Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .",adventure
3506,"It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .",adventure
3507,The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .,adventure
3508,His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .,adventure
3509,Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! !,adventure
3510,You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .,adventure
3511,"Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .",adventure
3512,Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .,adventure
3513,Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .,adventure
3514,"Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .",adventure
3515,But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .,adventure
3516,"It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .",adventure
3517,Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .,adventure
3518,She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! !,adventure
3519,Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .,adventure
3520,Such a pitiful end '' ! !,adventure
3521,"Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .",adventure
3522,"The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .",adventure
3523,"Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives .",adventure
3524,"So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .",adventure
3525,"Once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .",adventure
3526,"Mrs. Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .",adventure
3527,"The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .",adventure
3528,The girl was not more than 16 .,adventure
3529,She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .,adventure
3530,The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ;,adventure
3531,the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .,adventure
3532,"The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !",adventure
3533,They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !,adventure
3534,"`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! !",adventure
3535,"Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .",adventure
3536,"`` There ain't nothin' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say .",adventure
3537,"`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! !",adventure
3538,"There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' .",adventure
3539,"He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .",adventure
3540,"Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .",adventure
3541,Ever since all that .,adventure
3542,He was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .,adventure
3543,Out and out and never to return again .,adventure
3544,"The freight car was cold , early in the morning .",adventure
3545,"He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .",adventure
3546,"He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .",adventure
3547,"The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ;",adventure
3548,"at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .",adventure
3549,The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .,adventure
3550,"She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop's music pfffted away .",adventure
3551,"`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .",adventure
3552,"A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .",adventure
3553,"Hot , that was the word , hot ! !",adventure
3554,"A poet , yet ! !",adventure
3555,"His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .",adventure
3556,Zingggg-O ! !,adventure
3557,"Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .",adventure
3558,"He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .",adventure
3559,"Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished .",adventure
3560,"`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .",adventure
3561,`` Ah-ah '' ! !,adventure
3562,"Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .",adventure
3563,`` None of that .,adventure
3564,We run a respectable house here '' .,adventure
3565,"They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .",adventure
3566,"He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .",adventure
3567,"`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .",adventure
3568,`` That crap is softer over here '' .,adventure
3569,"The girl smiled , and started forward .",adventure
3570,"The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .",adventure
3571,"`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .",adventure
3572,`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .,adventure
3573,"`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .",adventure
3574,This guy was strictly from Outsville .,adventure
3575,But nowhere ! !,adventure
3576,`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?,adventure
3577,"Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall .",adventure
3578,"`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said .",adventure
3579,His head came up and he said it defiantly .,adventure
3580,Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .,adventure
3581,These two were going to be easy pickins .,adventure
3582,"They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .",adventure
3583,"And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn't have .",adventure
3584,That was gonna be fun collecting ! !,adventure
3585,But not just yet .,adventure
3586,Feathertop was a connoisseur .,adventure
3587,He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .,adventure
3588,"`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .",adventure
3589,"`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' .",adventure
3590,"`` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused .",adventure
3591,Feathertop aimed a finger at him .,adventure
3592,"`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided .",adventure
3593,He's a nice guy '' .,adventure
3594,"She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .",adventure
3595,"Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .",adventure
3596,He cleared his throat ; ;,adventure
3597,"He had it all doped , of course .",adventure
3598,"Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll .",adventure
3599,"`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?",adventure
3600,Kitty inquired politely .,adventure
3601,`` Where from '' ? ?,adventure
3602,He mused .,adventure
3603,`` Out .,adventure
3604,I been riding train for a ways now '' .,adventure
3605,"They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .",adventure
3606,"After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' .",adventure
3607,"`` What's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ?",adventure
3608,Ernie found it immensely funny .,adventure
3609,`` No ! !,adventure
3610,She snapped at him .,adventure
3611,`` I only said I was hungry .,adventure
3612,We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .,adventure
3613,"Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .",adventure
3614,"`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! !",adventure
3615,"Why , we got dinner right here .",adventure
3616,"C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' .",adventure
3617,"Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .",adventure
3618,Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .,adventure
3619,"He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .",adventure
3620,"`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .",adventure
3621,Charcoal '' ? ?,adventure
3622,He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .,adventure
3623,"`` Hot dogs , man .",adventure
3624,"Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .",adventure
3625,"He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .",adventure
3626,He looked up and grinned .,adventure
3627,"`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained .",adventure
3628,"`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ?",adventure
3629,Ernie asked .,adventure
3630,"Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .",adventure
3631,"But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father .",adventure
3632,He didn't want us to get married .,adventure
3633,`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ?,adventure
3634,This time even she did not answer .,adventure
3635,"She looked down at her hands , too .",adventure
3636,"After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy .",adventure
3637,It was my fault '' .,adventure
3638,"`` Your fault , hell ! !",adventure
3639,It was all my fault .,adventure
3640,If I'd been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .,adventure
3641,Ernie's eyebrows went up .,adventure
3642,"The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' .",adventure
3643,Cappy raged at himself .,adventure
3644,"`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !",adventure
3645,"You never heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know '' ? ?",adventure
3646,This was a slightly different matter .,adventure
3647,"But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .",adventure
3648,A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .,adventure
3649,But these kids weren't like him .,adventure
3650,"He thought , Pull out of it , old son .",adventure
3651,These are just another couple of characters to roll .,adventure
3652,"What they got , you get .",adventure
3653,Now forget all this other .,adventure
3654,`` Wanna drink '' ? ?,adventure
3655,"Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .",adventure
3656,`` Yeah .,adventure
3657,Now that you offer '' .,adventure
3658,The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .,adventure
3659,"From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .",adventure
3660,Ernie stared at the man .,adventure
3661,He was big .,adventure
3662,"`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ?",adventure
3663,"The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .",adventure
3664,Ernie hesitated a moment .,adventure
3665,This character could break him in half .,adventure
3666,"`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .",adventure
3667,He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .,adventure
3668,"The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .",adventure
3669,"He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .",adventure
3670,"He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .",adventure
3671,"He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .",adventure
3672,"`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .",adventure
3673,`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .,adventure
3674,"`` We're going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .",adventure
3675,"He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .",adventure
3676,"`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' .",adventure
3677,"He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .",adventure
3678,"The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .",adventure
3679,"Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .",adventure
3680,The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! !,adventure
3681,And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .,adventure
3682,They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .,adventure
3683,"The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .",adventure
3684,"The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` Aaawww '' ! !",adventure
3685,"Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .",adventure
3686,He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .,adventure
3687,"He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .",adventure
3688,Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .,adventure
3689,"She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him ! !",adventure

3698,The word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal's words gave him knotty difficulty ; ;,science_fiction
3699,"there was no Martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby .",science_fiction

3831,`` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings '' ! !,science_fiction
3832,"Said Hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak .",science_fiction
3833,Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes .,science_fiction
3834,He said sharply .,science_fiction
3835,"`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .",science_fiction
3836,`` But it was inevitable ! !,science_fiction
3837,Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found ? ?,science_fiction
3838,How could they not ? ?,science_fiction
3839,"I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough .",science_fiction
3840,Was ? ?,science_fiction
3841,"As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was .",science_fiction
3842,He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him .,science_fiction
3843,He is now my block gapt .,science_fiction
3844,He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. R.'s .,science_fiction
3845,"Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest .",science_fiction
3846,"No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me .",science_fiction
3847,"If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does .",science_fiction
3848,"If I die , I die because I willed it so .",science_fiction
3849,"So , forgive me , Sigmen , for the contrary-to-reality thoughts ! !",science_fiction
3850,"`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .",science_fiction
3851,`` But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet ? ?,science_fiction
3852,"Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the Forerunner himself '' ? ?",science_fiction
3853,"`` No '' , said Macneff .",science_fiction
3854,`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there .,science_fiction
3855,The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth .,science_fiction
3856,"I can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere .",science_fiction
3857,`` You need a linguist '' ? ?,science_fiction
3858,Said Hal .,science_fiction
3859,"`` The ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one .",science_fiction
3860,We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion .,science_fiction
3861,Unfortunately '',science_fiction
3862,"Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning .",science_fiction
3863,Therefore '',science_fiction
3864,"`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal .",science_fiction
3865,`` But I have just thought of one thing .,science_fiction
3866,I am married '' .,science_fiction
3867,`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel .,science_fiction
3868,"And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' .",science_fiction
3869,"Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course .",science_fiction
3870,"But , from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce .",science_fiction
3871,"It's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years .",science_fiction
3872,"`` I volunteer '' , said Hal .",science_fiction
3873,"`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' .",science_fiction
3874,"Six months later , Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him .",science_fiction
3875,"It was night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast Asia , India , Siberia .",science_fiction
3876,"Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein .",science_fiction
3877,"Australia , the Philippine Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American .",science_fiction
3878,"Southern China , all of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar .",science_fiction
3879,Siberia spoke Icelandic .,science_fiction
3880,"His mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea .",science_fiction
3881,"All around the Mediterranean Sea , Asia Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue .",science_fiction
3882,"This was no man's land , disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years .",science_fiction
3883,"Neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War .",science_fiction
3884,"So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) .",science_fiction
3885,"Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean Islands , and the eastern half of South America .",science_fiction
3886,Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War .,science_fiction
3887,"Then there was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve .",science_fiction
3888,"Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .",science_fiction
3889,"And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .",science_fiction
3890,"But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .",science_fiction
3891,"She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed .",science_fiction
3892,"If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .",science_fiction
3893,There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .,science_fiction
3894,"Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .",science_fiction
3895,Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ;,science_fiction
3896,he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome .,science_fiction
3897,"Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .",science_fiction
3898,He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; ;,science_fiction
3899,"Mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage .",science_fiction
3900,"She would have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt .",science_fiction
3901,Perhaps .,science_fiction
3902,Hal doubted if this happy event would occur .,science_fiction
3903,Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .,science_fiction
3904,The gapt .,science_fiction
3905,Pornsen .,science_fiction
3906,"He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice",science_fiction
3907,`` Hal Yarrow '' ! !,science_fiction
3908,Said the whining voice .,science_fiction
3909,"And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned .",science_fiction
3910,"`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice .",science_fiction
3911,"`` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage .",science_fiction
3912,But I might have known ! !,science_fiction
3913,Sigmen himself must have foreseen it .,science_fiction
3914,"Love to you , my ward '' .",science_fiction
3915,"`` Sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking .",science_fiction
3916,I had thought we would never again speak to each other '' .,science_fiction
3917,5,science_fiction
3918,"the Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one-gee acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed of light .",science_fiction
3919,"Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor .",science_fiction
3920,Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years .,science_fiction
3921,"Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others .",science_fiction
3922,"Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end .",science_fiction
3923,"Many years later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .",science_fiction
3924,"Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied .",science_fiction
3925,"Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration .",science_fiction
3926,And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation .,science_fiction
3927,These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel .,science_fiction
3928,"He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo .",science_fiction
3929,The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words .,science_fiction
3930,The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .,science_fiction
3931,"And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases .",science_fiction
3932,"Yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly .",science_fiction
3933,"Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .",science_fiction
3934,"For one thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's ; ;",science_fiction
3935,"the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .",science_fiction
3936,"It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? ?",science_fiction
3937,Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .,science_fiction
3938,"Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word .",science_fiction
3939,"Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa .",science_fiction
3940,The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .,science_fiction
3941,"Fortunately , gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo .",science_fiction
3942,The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .,science_fiction
3943,"This was not , for the Angel , just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise .",science_fiction
3944,No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer .,science_fiction
3945,"What Gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives .",science_fiction
3946,This is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time .,science_fiction
3947,"( Or , perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago .",science_fiction
3948,),science_fiction
3949,He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked .,science_fiction
3950,"`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly .",science_fiction
3951,`` We had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice .,science_fiction
3952,Of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; ;,science_fiction
3953,"individually they are nearly as mortal as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists .",science_fiction
3954,"But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young .",science_fiction
3955,We shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half .,science_fiction
3956,"`` For now , it is clear that we were in the wrong .",science_fiction
3957,"Hesperus , you may speak '' .",science_fiction
3958,"`` I did not perceive this essential distinction either , First-Born '' , Hesperus said at once , `` I was only practicing a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal '' .",science_fiction
3959,"`` Nevertheless , you were its agent .",science_fiction
3960,"Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ?",science_fiction
3961,"`` It's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said .",science_fiction
3962,"`` We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' .",science_fiction
3963,"`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .",science_fiction
3964,"Between individuals , this process is called bargaining .",science_fiction
3965,"When it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty .",science_fiction
3966,And the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine .,science_fiction
3967,Recovering the property was much less important '' .,science_fiction
3968,"`` Strange '' , Gabriel said .",science_fiction
3969,"Though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us '' .",science_fiction
3970,"`` Hesperus and Lucifer '' , Jack said , `` show that we do '' .",science_fiction
3971,Another pause ; ;,science_fiction
3972,but this one was not nearly as long .,science_fiction
3973,`` Then it is a matter of pleasure ; ;,science_fiction
3974,of curiosity ; ;,science_fiction
3975,of a more alive time .,science_fiction
3976,"But you should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery .",science_fiction
3977,Visiting the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older '' .,science_fiction
3978,This explained a great deal .,science_fiction
3979,"`` All the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty .",science_fiction
3980,"`` But this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in turn .",science_fiction
3981,To this we of course agree '' .,science_fiction
3982,"Jack felt a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanished without a trace .",science_fiction
3983,"The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust .",science_fiction
3984,Nothing less would serve .,science_fiction
3985,"And it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war .",science_fiction
3986,"Furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified .",science_fiction
3987,"Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders .",science_fiction
3988,"but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban , and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question .",science_fiction
3989,"Out of that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations ; ;",science_fiction
3990,"Besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be thrashed out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history .",science_fiction
3991,Suppose that this one were to work ? ?,science_fiction
3992,"There was no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least .",science_fiction
3993,If mankind could be convinced of that,science_fiction
3994,It was worth trying .,science_fiction
3995,"In fact , it had to be tried .",science_fiction
3996,"Secretary Hart had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters ; ;",science_fiction
3997,but there was no small way to handle this one .,science_fiction
3998,"He turned back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips .",science_fiction
3999,But he was too late .,science_fiction
4000,For a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw .,science_fiction
4001,"It seemed to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity .",science_fiction
4002,"Gradually , he realized that the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up .",science_fiction
4003,`` Hesperus ! !,science_fiction
4004,What's going on here ? ?,science_fiction
4005,What's happened '' ? ?,science_fiction
4006,They are on their way here '' .,science_fiction
4007,I don't see them .,science_fiction
4008,The instruments don't show them '' .,science_fiction
4009,"Jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again .",science_fiction
4010,Nothing .,science_fiction
4011,No -- there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ;,science_fiction
4012,"If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed .",science_fiction
4013,"It was a startling , almost numenous sight ; ;",science_fiction
4014,but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet's-tail of Angels .,science_fiction
4015,"The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however .",science_fiction
4016,"And there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone .",science_fiction
4017,"Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him .",science_fiction
4018,"The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars .",science_fiction
4019,"He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast .",science_fiction
4020,But where was it going ? ?,science_fiction
4021,"And why was it causing so much agitation among the Angels , and being followed by so many of them ? ?",science_fiction
4022,"There was only one possible answer , but Jack's horrified mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's course into the computer .",science_fiction
4023,"The skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula -- toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the Angel's life and religion .",science_fiction
4024,It was clear that Langer had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention .,science_fiction
4025,"It was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off .",science_fiction
4026,Stern chase 10,science_fiction
4027,"Langer would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not .",science_fiction
4028,Almost surely he did ; ;,science_fiction
4029,"But not having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line .",science_fiction
4030,"Had he decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith '' ? ?",science_fiction
4031,"But it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy of Holies , or was simply headed in that direction by accident .",science_fiction
4032,"If it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ;",science_fiction
4033,"and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous .",science_fiction
4034,Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the Nernst generator switch .,science_fiction
4035,"When he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated .",science_fiction
4036,"He had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast .",science_fiction
4037,But fusion power in the Coal Sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an Angel aboard .,science_fiction
4038,`` Hesperus '' ? ?,science_fiction
4039,`` Receiving '' .,science_fiction
4040,"`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do .",science_fiction
4041,But I can't take you to Earth yet .,science_fiction
4042,First I've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble .,science_fiction
4043,"Will you obstruct this , or will you help ? ?",science_fiction
4044,"I know it's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it '' .",science_fiction
4045,"`` Nobody else can live in your hearth while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly .",science_fiction
4046,"`` As for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong .",science_fiction
4047,"If because of this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at all .",science_fiction
4048,Therefore of course I will help '' .,science_fiction
4049,"With a short-lived sigh of relief , Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch .",science_fiction
4050,"Always before , it had taken five minutes to --",science_fiction
4051,Of course .,science_fiction
4052,Hesperus was in there .,science_fiction
4053,"`` Hesperus , don't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please .",science_fiction
4054,Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow .,science_fiction
4055,He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw .,science_fiction
4056,"`` Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured '' , Nogol said .",science_fiction
4057,He didn't say what would cure him ; ;,science_fiction
4058,Ryan insisted .,science_fiction
4059,"`` Well , let's take a ground-level look at the country around here '' .",science_fiction
4060,"A range of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss .",science_fiction
4061,"Above them , the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis , seen against neon-lit snow .",science_fiction
4062,"That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light .",science_fiction
4063,"It seemed almost a magnification of the Galaxy itself , of the Milky Way , blown up by some master photographer .",science_fiction
4064,"This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar System .",science_fiction
4065,"These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere .",science_fiction
4066,"But to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did .",science_fiction
4067,This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations .,science_fiction
4068,"They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history .",science_fiction
4069,"`` Some can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said elaborately .",science_fiction
4070,"`` What will we need outside , Ryan '' ? ?",science_fiction
4071,Ekstrohm asked .,science_fiction
4072,"`` No helmets '' , the captain answered .",science_fiction
4073,It just won't be easy .,science_fiction
4074,Nitrogen and oxygen are about it '' .,science_fiction
4075,"`` Ryan , look over there '' , Nogol said .",science_fiction
4076,`` Animals .,science_fiction
4077,Ringing the ship .,science_fiction
4078,"Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?",science_fiction
4079,"`` I think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly .",science_fiction
4080,`` I get no readings from them at all .,science_fiction
4081,"Sonic , electronic , galvanic -- all blank .",science_fiction
4082,"According to these needles , they're stone dead '' .",science_fiction
4083,Take it easy '' .,science_fiction
4084,"`` Easy '' , Nogol confirmed .",science_fiction
4085,"Remember , when the little hand is straight up that's negative .",science_fiction
4086,Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' .,science_fiction
4087,Ryan told him what he could do then .,science_fiction
4088,"Ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall .",science_fiction
4089,The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects .,science_fiction
4090,"Actually , the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories .",science_fiction
4091,He wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever .,science_fiction
4092,"They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground .",science_fiction
4093,"It was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow .",science_fiction
4094,"They walked from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side .",science_fiction
4095,Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot .,science_fiction
4096,"`` Uh-huh '' , Ryan admitted .",science_fiction
4097,`` One of the best matches I've ever found .,science_fiction
4098,"Well , it has to happen .",science_fiction
4099,Statistical average and all .,science_fiction
4100,"Still , it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world .",science_fiction
4101,"It makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started '' .",science_fiction
4102,The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain .,science_fiction
4103,The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts .,science_fiction
4104,Ekstrohm cleared his throat .,science_fiction
4105,`` What shall we do with this one ? ?,science_fiction
4106,Dissect it '' ? ?,science_fiction
4107,It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me .,science_fiction
4108,"No hands , for one thing .",science_fiction
4109,"Of course , that's not definite proof '' .",science_fiction
4110,"`` No , it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said .",science_fiction
4111,`` I think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here .,science_fiction
4112,"In the meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent .",science_fiction
4113,What killed them '' ? ?,science_fiction
4114,"`` It looks like we did , when we made blastdown '' .",science_fiction
4115,`` But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures '' ? ?,science_fiction
4116,`` Radiation '' ? ?,science_fiction
4117,"`` The planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output .",science_fiction
4118,Any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters '' .,science_fiction

4122,They curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship '' .,science_fiction
4123,"`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted .",science_fiction

4127,I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too .,science_fiction
4128,These critters went real sudden '' .,science_fiction
4129,"Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet .",science_fiction
4130,"There was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out .",science_fiction
4131,"The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being .",science_fiction
4132,"Each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship .",science_fiction
4133,Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138 .,science_fiction
4134,"There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground .",science_fiction
4135,"Insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun .",science_fiction
4136,The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board .,science_fiction
4137,"Yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum .",science_fiction
4138,Ekstrohm was not asleep .,science_fiction
4139,Now there could be an end to pretending .,science_fiction
4140,There was no longer any need to hide .,science_fiction
4141,But what was there to do ? ?,science_fiction
4142,What had changed for him ? ?,science_fiction
4143,"In privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read .",science_fiction
4144,It was small comfort for insomnia .,science_fiction
4145,Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this .,science_fiction
4146,"Actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot .",science_fiction
4147,Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .,science_fiction
4148,His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons .,science_fiction
4149,"Occasionally he fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; ;",science_fiction
4150,but he never slept .,science_fiction
4151,Never at all .,science_fiction
4152,"Naturally , he couldn't let his shipmates know this .",science_fiction
4153,He had to hide it .,science_fiction
4154,"Over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide .",science_fiction
4155,"Since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports .",science_fiction
4156,Where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain ? ?,science_fiction
4157,A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him .,science_fiction
4158,Ekstrohm had to hide his secret .,science_fiction
4159,"In a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier .",science_fiction
4160,But the secret itself was just as hard .,science_fiction
4161,"Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ship's library , a book by Bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex .",science_fiction
4162,"He scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style .",science_fiction
4163,"On impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble .",science_fiction
4164,"Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air .",science_fiction
4165,"Behind him , his mates stirred without waking .",science_fiction
4166,Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble .,science_fiction
4167,"It took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly .",science_fiction
4168,The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .,science_fiction
4169,"`` Okay , Stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games .",science_fiction
4170,What did you do with them '' ? ?,science_fiction
4171,`` Do with what '' ? ?,science_fiction
4172,`` The dead beasties .,science_fiction

4175,All I know is that they are gone '' .,science_fiction
4176,`` Gone '' ? ?,science_fiction
4177,Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt .,science_fiction
4178,There was no ring of animal corpses .,science_fiction
4179,Nothing .,science_fiction
4180,Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .,science_fiction
4181,"`` I'll be damned '' , Ekstrohm said .",science_fiction
4182,"`` You are right now , buddy .",science_fiction
4183,Ekstrohm demanded .,science_fiction
4184,`` Why pick me for your patsy ? ?,science_fiction
4185,Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this '' ? ?,science_fiction
4186,"`` Listen , Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt .",science_fiction

4188,"You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' .",science_fiction
4189,"`` No '' , Ekstrohm said , `` No , I didn't know that '' .",science_fiction
4190,`` You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we've made with you .,science_fiction
4191,Now comes this ! !,science_fiction
4192,It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in '' .,science_fiction
4193,`` What could I do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?,science_fiction
4194,What would I want with them '' ? ?,science_fiction
4195,"`` All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web .",science_fiction
4196,The tapes show that .,science_fiction
4197,"Now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' .",science_fiction
4198,It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm .,science_fiction
4199,No .,science_fiction
4200,Suspicion wasn't new to him at all .,science_fiction
4201,"`` Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies .",science_fiction
4202,"Look for them , will you ? ?",science_fiction
4203,"I give you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition .",science_fiction
4204,"Take my word , can't you '' ? ?",science_fiction
4205,`` I don't think I can .,science_fiction
4206,There's still such a thing as mental illness .,science_fiction
4207,You may not be responsible '' .,science_fiction
4208,Ekstrohm scowled .,science_fiction
4209,"`` Don't try anything violent , Stormy .",science_fiction
4210,I outweigh you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' .,science_fiction
4211,`` I wasn't planning on jumping you .,science_fiction
4212,Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?,science_fiction
4213,Helva .,science_fiction
4214,She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery .,science_fiction
4215,Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began .,science_fiction
4216,"One of the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells .",science_fiction
4217,"Instead of kicking feet , Helva's neural responses started her wheels ; ;",science_fiction
4218,"instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .",science_fiction
4219,"As she matured , more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship .",science_fiction
4220,Her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high .,science_fiction
4221,"As long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , Helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being .",science_fiction
4222,"However , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn .",science_fiction
4223,"They would have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession .",science_fiction
4224,A ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships .,science_fiction
4225,"Brain ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages .",science_fiction
4226,"And very , very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine .",science_fiction
4227,"Shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the Universe .",science_fiction
4228,"So , for happy years , Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as Stall , Power-Seek , studying her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen .",science_fiction
4229,She would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction .,science_fiction
4230,"Helva's civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens .",science_fiction
4231,One such group got all incensed over shelled `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen .,science_fiction
4232,"When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs .",science_fiction
4233,Very few committees ever looked past the first few photos .,science_fiction
4234,Most of their original objections about `` shells '' were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed .,science_fiction
4235,"Helva's class was doing Fine Arts , a selective subject in her crowded program .",science_fiction
4236,She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel .,science_fiction
4237,"Her subject was large -- a copy of the Last Supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw .",science_fiction
4238,She had tuned her sight to the proper degree .,science_fiction
4239,Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths .,science_fiction
4240,"Helva's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings .",science_fiction
4241,"`` Why , what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors .",science_fiction
4242,"Helva `` looked '' up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface .",science_fiction
4243,Her hum became a gurgle of surprise .,science_fiction
4244,She instinctively regulated her `` sight '' until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions .,science_fiction
4245,"`` Yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , madam '' , remarked Helva calmly .",science_fiction
4246,`` Vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated .,science_fiction
4247,I enjoyed my lessons '' .,science_fiction
4248,"Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly .",science_fiction
4249,Any other reaction would have been reported instantly .,science_fiction
4250,"`` I meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended .",science_fiction
4251,`` Thank you .,science_fiction
4252,Would you like to see my work '' ? ?,science_fiction
4253,`` Work '' ? ?,science_fiction
4254,Asked the lady .,science_fiction
4255,`` I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' .,science_fiction
4256,Helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically .,science_fiction
4257,"`` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy '' .",science_fiction
4258,`` You people don't have adjustable vision '' .,science_fiction
4259,"`` Here , this will help '' , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture .",science_fiction
4260,"In a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of a screw .",science_fiction
4261,"`` Well '' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread '' .",science_fiction
4262,"`` Are you referring , sir '' , asked Helva politely , `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? ?",science_fiction
4263,"`` If you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' .",science_fiction
4264,`` Which you are programed to compute '' ? ?,science_fiction
4265,`` Of course '' .,science_fiction
4266,"`` We are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect '' .",science_fiction
4267,The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time .,science_fiction
4268,"If the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School , they left Helva with a morsel as well .",science_fiction
4269,`` Singing '' as applicable to herself required research .,science_fiction
4270,"She had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` Tristan und Isolde '' , `` Candide '' , `` Oklahoma '' , `` Nozze de Figaro '' , the atomic age singers , Eileen Farrell , Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd , as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians , Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians .",science_fiction
4271,But `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .,science_fiction
4272,"Therefore to Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her .",science_fiction
4273,"She would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing .",science_fiction
4274,Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .,science_fiction
4275,Breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice .,science_fiction
4276,"Shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe .",science_fiction
4277,"For their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells .",science_fiction
4278,"After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone .",science_fiction
4279,"By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone .",science_fiction
4280,"She compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all unharmonious , merely unique .",science_fiction
4281,Acquiring a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall .,science_fiction
4282,She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy .,science_fiction
4283,"It would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she pleased .",science_fiction
4284,"If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves .",science_fiction
4285,Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work .,science_fiction
4286,"On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the Aj .",science_fiction
4287,"The neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed .",science_fiction
4288,"Her extendibles were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings .",science_fiction
4289,Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed .,science_fiction
4290,"She could take care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of Central Worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine .",science_fiction
4291,"Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession .",science_fiction
4292,There were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned .,science_fiction
4293,There were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section .,science_fiction
4294,The ship always chose its own partner .,science_fiction
4295,"Had there been another `` brain '' ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move .",science_fiction
4296,"As it was , while Central wrangled among itself , Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks , out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull .",science_fiction
4297,"`` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ?",science_fiction
4298,Tanner wisecracked .,science_fiction
4299,"`` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners .",science_fiction
4300,`` Are you my partner '' ? ?,science_fiction
4301,"She asked hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform .",science_fiction
4302,"`` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully .",science_fiction
4303,`` No one has come .,science_fiction
4304,"Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field .",science_fiction
4305,"Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score .",science_fiction
4306,The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive .,science_fiction
4307,"`` No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' .",science_fiction
4308,It would have killed you in the cabin .,science_fiction
4309,Do you have anything for me '' ? ?,science_fiction
4310,"Mercer stammered , not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him , `` I think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet '' .",science_fiction
4311,Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm .,science_fiction
4312,B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer .,science_fiction
4313,"He tried to run after B'dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him .",science_fiction
4314,"He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt .",science_fiction
4315,The many-bodied girl lay near him .,science_fiction
4316,Mercer spoke to her .,science_fiction
4317,"You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful .",science_fiction
4318,The woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them .,science_fiction
4319,She radiated warmth and good fellowship .,science_fiction
4320,He struggled out of his clothes .,science_fiction
4321,It was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did .,science_fiction
4322,"With one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it .",science_fiction
4323,With most of his mind he was happy .,science_fiction
4324,He wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this .,science_fiction
4325,"He tried to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight .",science_fiction
4326,The drug went after the pain and swallowed it .,science_fiction
4327,"The pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time .",science_fiction
4328,He forced himself to be deliberate .,science_fiction
4329,"He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite .",science_fiction
4330,Maybe I will grow another head .,science_fiction
4331,That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! !,science_fiction
4332,"Said she , `` I'm strong , too .",science_fiction
4333,"We can die , too , we can die like real people .",science_fiction
4334,I do so believe in death '' ! !,science_fiction
4335,`` Of course you can .,science_fiction
4336,But isn't this nice '',science_fiction
4337,With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack .,science_fiction
4338,"In that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled .",science_fiction
4339,B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives .,science_fiction
4340,Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him .,science_fiction
4341,He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement .,science_fiction
4342,"He watched his own body with remote , casual interest .",science_fiction
4343,The Lady Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him .,science_fiction
4344,"Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining .",science_fiction
4345,The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ;,science_fiction
4346,the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body .,science_fiction
4347,At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain .,science_fiction
4348,The pains themselves had not changed ; ;,science_fiction
4349,he had .,science_fiction
4350,He knew all the events which could take place on Shayol .,science_fiction
4351,He remembered them well from his happy period .,science_fiction
4352,"He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again .",science_fiction
4353,"She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ;",science_fiction
4354,"She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech .",science_fiction
4355,"The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity .",science_fiction
4356,"The half-man woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin .",science_fiction
4357,"`` ' A good morrow to you , my boy .",science_fiction
4358,That's out of a play .,science_fiction
4359,`` You mean a game with cards '' ? ?,science_fiction
4360,"`` I never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' --",science_fiction
4361,We all know what is going to happen .,science_fiction
4362,We all know when it is going to happen .,science_fiction
4363,We all know what the dummies will do '' -- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask .,science_fiction

4365,`` What's a ' scene ' '' ? ?,science_fiction
4366,`` Is that the name for the needle '' ? ?,science_fiction
4367,The half-man laughed with something close to real humor .,science_fiction
4368,You've got the lovelies on the brain .,science_fiction
4369,A scene is just a part of a play .,science_fiction
4370,"I mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes .",science_fiction
4371,The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long .,science_fiction
4372,I'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each '' .,science_fiction
4373,"Mercer did not know what an `` Earth-week '' was , since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time .",science_fiction
4374,"The half-man received a dromozootic implant , turned red in the face , shouted senselessly at Mercer , `` Take it out , you fool ! !",science_fiction
4375,Take it out of me '' ! !,science_fiction
4376,"When Mercer looked on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself .",science_fiction
4377,Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back .,science_fiction
4378,It might have been several days .,science_fiction
4379,It might have been several months .,science_fiction
4380,Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ;,science_fiction
4381,once again they clustered like children .,science_fiction
4382,"This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer's thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes .",science_fiction
4383,Mercer got the blissful needle .,science_fiction
4384,"When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body .",science_fiction
4385,He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ;,science_fiction
4386,"he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately .",science_fiction
4387,The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .,science_fiction
4388,Then there had been another head beside his own .,science_fiction
4389,"Or was that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? ?",science_fiction
4390,He forgot the order .,science_fiction
4391,He did not count time .,science_fiction
4392,"Lady Da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place .",science_fiction
4393,"In between teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman ; ;",science_fiction
4394,"but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever '' .",science_fiction
4395,"She found this immensely comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it .",science_fiction
4396,"Thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived .",science_fiction
4397,The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them .,science_fiction
4398,"Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin .",science_fiction
4399,"Only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it .",science_fiction

4434,"As a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .",religion
4435,Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ?,religion
4436,The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .,religion
4437,For in the modern world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .,religion
4438,We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .,religion
4439,"When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .",religion
4440,Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .,religion
4441,"Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .",religion
4442,In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .,religion
4443,"In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .",religion
4444,The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .,religion
4445,In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .,religion
4446,The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .,religion
4447,Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .,religion
4448,"When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .",religion
4449,"In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .",religion
4450,"There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .",religion
4451,"All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .",religion
4452,"The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .",religion
4453,We simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .,religion
4454,"There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .",religion
4455,Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .,religion
4456,"The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials .",religion
4457,As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century .,religion
4458,"Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .",religion
4459,"The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .",religion
4460,There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .,religion
4461,"Instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .",religion
4462,"A teenage girl , Abigail Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend Samuel Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .",religion
4463,"For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .",religion
4464,"As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .",religion
4465,"Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .",religion
4466,"It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .",religion
4467,"It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .",religion
4468,"The audience leaves the play under a spell , It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .",religion
4469,"In the end the good man , John Proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` A fire , a fire is burning ! !",religion
4470,"I hear the boot of Lucifer , I see his filthy face '' ! !",religion
4471,The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .,religion
4472,We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .,religion
4473,"Yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ?",religion
4474,In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .,religion
4475,Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score .,religion
4476,"In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants .",religion
4477,And his belief is not to his discredit .,religion
4478,"When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' .",religion
4479,Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .,religion
4480,It casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .,religion
4481,It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .,religion
4482,"For this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .",religion
4483,The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary .,religion
4484,Spirit and community,religion
4485,"Apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .",religion
4486,"Think , for example , of the spirit of the Marine Corps .",religion
4487,Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .,religion
4488,"We cannot , of course , assign it any substance .",religion
4489,It is not material and is not a `` thing '' occupying space and time .,religion
4490,Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .,religion
4491,"So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan .",religion
4492,"Every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .",religion
4493,"In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .",religion
4494,For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .,religion
4495,It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .,religion
4496,It is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .,religion
4497,Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .,religion
4498,The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .,religion
4499,It is for them a given which they and they alone possess .,religion
4500,The spirit of the Marine Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .,religion
4501,"It is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .",religion
4502,"If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .",religion
4503,This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .,religion
4504,The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .,religion
4505,"When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence .",religion
4506,"Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .",religion
4507,"The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' .",religion
4508,But this statement is completely unconvincing .,religion
4509,Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .,religion
4510,"Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .",religion
4511,This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .,religion
4512,"Time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .",religion
4513,The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches .,religion
4514,"In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation .",religion
4515,This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .,religion
4516,"However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .",religion
4517,"To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians .",religion
4518,But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?,religion
4519,"Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?",religion
4520,Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?,religion
4521,"By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .",religion
4522,"But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it .",religion
4523,"And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .",religion
4524,"Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .",religion
4525,and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .,religion
4526,This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .,religion
4527,"If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .",religion
4528,"Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .",religion
4529,This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .,religion
4530,"Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ;",religion
4531,"and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; ;",religion
4532,and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .,religion
4533,"In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .",religion
4534,"To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .",religion
4535,"We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann .",religion
4536,It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .,religion
4537,"Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .",religion
4538,What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .,religion
4539,"Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .",religion
4540,"They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .",religion
4541,"When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .",religion
4542,In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led .,religion
4543,"For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .",religion
4544,"Whereas Bultmann's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .",religion
4545,"It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .",religion
4546,"In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .",religion
4547,"We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .",religion
4548,"To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .",religion
4549,"Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .",religion
4550,"Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ;",religion
4551,"for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .",religion
4552,"Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .",religion
4553,A second point requires more extended comment .,religion
4554,"It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ;",religion
4555,( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; ;,religion
4556,"and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological .",religion
4557,One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom .,religion
4558,"Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 .",religion
4559,"Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity .",religion
4560,"The Church Unity Octave , January 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .",religion
4561,"Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .",religion
4562,"But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side .",religion
4563,"For the `` tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written .",religion
4564,"As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; ;",religion
4565,"being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant-dominated country .",religion
4566,but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England .,religion
4567,"Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric .",religion
4568,"In any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .",religion
4569,Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .,religion
4570,"On my first Guy Fawkes Day here , I found Catholics as well as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .",religion
4571,"A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` The True Story of Guy Fawkes '' , which began :",religion
4572,"`` When you pile your `` guy '' on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember ? ?",religion
4573,"In spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's , the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800,000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .",religion
4574,"The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .",religion
4575,In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers .,religion
4576,"Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million ) ; ;",religion
4577,yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .,religion
4578,A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .,religion
4579,"She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of English people are churchgoers .",religion
4580,"She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .",religion
4581,From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .,religion
4582,"A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred .",religion
4583,The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .,religion
4584,"According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9,748,000 , but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .",religion
4585,"An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate Of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years' time .",religion
4586,A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' .,religion
4587,"And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .",religion
4588,"Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics '' , and have done so .",religion
4589,"While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church .",religion
4590,"Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing .",religion
4591,An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .,religion
4592,"A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism , and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' .",religion
4593,"That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .",religion
4594,"One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite .",religion
4595,Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .,religion
4596,The London Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one hundred years .,religion
4597,"With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best .",religion
4598,I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics .,religion
4599,"It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass .",religion
4600,"They hope , of course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the `` Prayer for England '' :",religion
4601,"`` O Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy `` dowry '' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .",religion
4602,"'' A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith Of Our Fathers '' , which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary's prayers Shall win our country back to thee '' .",religion
4603,"The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .",religion
4604,"I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .",religion
4605,"For example , a writer in a recent number of The Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un-English ' '' .",religion
4606,"In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good .",religion
4607,One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities .,religion
4608,"At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .",religion
4609,"Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .",religion
4610,"Now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University .",religion
4611,Some Catholic priests lecture there ; ;,religion
4612,Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students .,religion
4613,The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .,religion
4614,"On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church of England , the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist Church .",religion
4615,"The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .",religion
4616,"There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .",religion
4617,Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian England .,religion
4618,"There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free Church minister and a Catholic priest .",religion
4619,"Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .",religion
4620,"A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr. Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr. Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury .",religion
4621,The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in England .,religion
4622,The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .,religion
4623,And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C.'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St. Mary's .,religion
4624,Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; ;,religion
4625,a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters ; ;,religion

4628,"The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .",religion
4629,"The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .",religion
4630,But how can one figure symbolize both ? ?,religion
4631,Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur .,religion
4632,"Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus .",religion
4633,"To be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; ;",religion
4634,he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man's history .,religion
4635,Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .,religion
4636,"His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .",religion
4637,"Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .",religion
4638,"Not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ; ;",religion
4639,for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .,religion
4640,"As represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ; ;",religion
4641,yet each historical event remains unique .,religion
4642,Christ is both unique and universal .,religion
4643,The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam .,religion
4644,"As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ .",religion
4645,"`` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?",religion
4646,"From God's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth .",religion
4647,"For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .",religion
4648,"Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .",religion
4649,"Adam and Eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .",religion
4650,"They were , in fact , children .",religion
4651,"therefore there is no need for him , as there is for Origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .",religion
4652,Historical existence is a created good .,religion
4653,The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : `` So God created man in his own image ; ;,religion
4654,in the similitude of God he created him '' .,religion
4655,"There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` If the ( Holy ) Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; ;",religion
4656,"and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of God ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of God ) through the Spirit '' .",religion
4657,Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; ;,religion
4658,"the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature .",religion
4659,"Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .",religion
4660,He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; ;,religion
4661,"for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .",religion
4662,Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows :,religion
4663,"`` So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .",religion
4664,"And He laid down for him certain conditions : so that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal ; ;",religion
4665,"but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' .",religion
4666,"These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; ;",religion
4667,yet he did not stop being human as a result .,religion
4668,"There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .",religion
4669,"Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality .",religion
4670,"He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' .",religion
4671,"The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .",religion
4672,`` Eve was disobedient ; ;,religion
4673,for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .,religion
4674,"And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ; ;",religion
4675,"so also did Mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race '' .",religion
4676,"Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' .",religion
4677,His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary .,religion
4678,That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ; ;,religion
4679,"for as it was Christ , the Word of God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .",religion
4680,"With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .",religion
4681,"`` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; ;",religion
4682,and disobedience to God entails death .,religion
4683,"Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it '' .",religion
4684,"This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday ; ;",religion
4685,he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .,religion
4686,"In any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .",religion
4687,The wages of sin is death .,religion
4688,"Man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed to the shape of death .",religion
4689,"Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules .",religion
4690,"Even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .",religion
4691,"`` Wherefore also He ( God ) drove him ( man ) out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .",religion
4692,"This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology ; ;",religion
4693,"As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life .",religion
4694,This applies to his picture of Adam .,religion
4695,It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .,religion
4696,"It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .",religion
4697,"This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek-speaking ones .",religion
4698,"Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .",religion
4699,"It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .",religion
4700,"These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .",religion
4701,"Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time .",religion
4702,"One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve ; ;",religion
4703,and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .,religion
4704,"The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .",religion
4705,"On the other hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .",religion
4706,"It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .",religion
4707,This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced .,religion
4708,"If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .",religion
4709,Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; ;,religion
4710,"for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .",religion
4711,"Because Christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .",religion
4712,"Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .",religion
4713,We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .,religion
4714,"One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .",religion
4715,Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion .,religion
4716,"Grant all this -- still , when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .",religion
4717,"Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; ;",religion
4718,"the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity '' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .",religion
4719,"Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi '' .",religion
4720,"Happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .",religion
4721,"Fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ; ;",religion

4726,Parker was never excommunicated .,religion
4727,"To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .",religion
4728,"Yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .",religion
4729,Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?,religion
4730,Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?,religion
4731,"However , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .",religion
4732,"Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .",religion
4733,"Hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .",religion
4734,"He still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .",religion
4735,"Actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .",religion
4736,It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .,religion
4737,"The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .",religion
4738,"Parker , along with Garrison and Charles Sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery .",religion
4739,"Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ;",religion
4740,"But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .",religion
4741,"Even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .",religion
4742,"The gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : `` No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .",religion

4936,"But , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .",religion
4937,"Thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .",religion

4939,The `` Lo Shu '' square as an expression of centrality,religion
4940,"The concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States , was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in dynasty ( 221-207 B.C. ) .",religion
4941,But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .,religion
4942,"but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .",religion
4943,"Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later ; ;",religion
4944,"yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B.C. to A.D. 220 ) .",religion
4945,"However , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .",religion
4946,"After all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .",religion
4947,"But , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the Han period .",religion
4948,"Although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three '' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle '' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .",religion
4949,"But , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts .",religion
4950,"Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo Shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .",religion
4951,"The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .",religion
4952,"Indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .",religion
4953,"If one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .",religion
4954,"Then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ; ;",religion
4955,"and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .",religion
4956,"Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ;",religion
4957,"it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .",religion
4958,"In fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese .",religion
4959,"For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ; ;",religion
4960,"and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .",religion
4961,"Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .",religion
4962,"The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality .",religion
4963,These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty .,religion
4964,"His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy .",religion
4965,"After this time , inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .",religion
4966,"All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.C. , also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .",religion
4967,"We find , for example , such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers , the Five Sacred Mountains , the Five Directions ( with Center ) , the Five Metals , Five Colors , Five Tastes , Five Odors , Five Musical Notes , Five Bodily Functions , Five Viscera , and many others .",religion
4968,"This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; ;",religion
4969,"And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?",religion
4970,This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking .,religion
4971,"Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought .",religion
4972,"Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .",religion
4973,"but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .",religion
4974,"The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty , when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School , which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen .",religion
4975,"According to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by Heaven , T'ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the Order of the Universe '' or `` the Universal Way '' .",religion
4976,"The Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ; ;",religion
4977,"Together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .",religion
4978,"We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang , while the even numbers were Yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .",religion
4979,"Instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , Yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence Yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence Yin ) ; ;",religion
4980,taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old China .,religion
4981,"Thus the middle number , 5 , represented Sung-Shan in Honan , Central China ; ;",religion

4989,"Note that by Western standards this plan was `` upside down '' , as it put North at the bottom and South at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered ; ;",religion

5069,They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .,religion

5074,The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church .,religion

5096,Chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members,religion
5097,The members of the `` family '' are drawn together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom .,religion
5098,Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .,religion
5099,This is no spectator-type experience ; ;,religion
5100,"Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .",religion
5101,"One denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991 -- a net growth of only 122,158 .",religion
5102,"Yet during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions .",religion
5103,"Another major church body had 4,499,608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444 .",religion
5104,"During this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship .",religion
5105,"Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago .",religion
5106,These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .,religion
5107,"Studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .",religion
5108,Something is wrong when these things happen .,religion
5109,The local `` family of God '' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .,religion
5110,Basic needs,religion
5111,"new members can become participating , growing members .",religion
5112,It must be planned and carefully developed .,religion
5113,The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .,religion
5114,"If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .",religion
5115,"However , it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship .",religion
5116,When they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians .,religion
5117,The Church expects certain things of those who become members .,religion
5118,The new members justifiably expect some things from their church family :,religion
5119,-- Sincere Christian love and understanding,religion
5120,-- Social and recreational activities,religion
5121,-- Opportunities for Christian service,religion
5122,-- Opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible,religion
5123,-- Creative prayer experiences,religion
5124,-- Guidance in Christian social concerns .,religion
5125,Men need unity and they need God .,religion
5126,"Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .",religion
5127,"The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .",religion
5128,Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .,religion
5129,The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind : `` Oh how we hate one another for the love of God '' ! !,religion
5130,The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .,religion
5131,It lies in institutions .,religion
5132,"Institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .",religion
5133,A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ; ;,religion
5134,Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ; ;,religion
5135,"in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .",religion
5136,Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .,religion
5137,"Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .",religion
5138,"Both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .",religion
5139,Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .,religion
5140,The only way that I can see is through communication .,religion
5141,Interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .,religion
5142,"Approached creatively , it is a high art .",religion
5143,"It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .",religion
5144,"In a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .",religion
5145,"I shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological .",religion
5146,1 ),religion
5147,By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure .,religion
5148,"Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .",religion
5149,Such needs may rise to pathological proportions .,religion
5150,"Modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality '' is `` the bigoted personality '' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .",religion
5151,"Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .",religion
5152,To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .,religion
5153,"It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .",religion
5154,2 ),religion
5155,"While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .",religion
5156,The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .,religion
5157,"Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .",religion
5158,"No less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since World War 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .",religion
5159,"Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .",religion
5160,"Actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .",religion
5161,"Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .",religion
5162,The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need .,religion
5163,"Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's .",religion
5164,All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand .,religion
5165,Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .,religion
5166,"The people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , Christians on the mainland of China .",religion
5167,"In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly Christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics .",religion
5168,The progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo .,religion
5169,I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program .,religion
5170,"He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .",religion
5171,"After returning to the United States and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available .",religion
5172,It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; ;,religion
5173,they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .,religion
5174,It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment .,religion
5175,"Ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World War 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .",religion
5176,The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; ;,religion
5177,neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews .,religion
5178,3 ),religion
5179,I turn finally to several theological developments .,religion
5180,1 .,religion
5181,Theocracy reconsidered .,religion
5182,"The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .",religion
5183,The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' .,religion
5184,"One of our foremost jurists , David Dudley Field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history '' .",religion
5185,"Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation .",religion
5186,"`` What is the point '' , Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is '' ? ?",religion
5187,The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular .,religion
5188,"And while the nation was formerly named `` The Islamic Republic of Pakistan '' , it is now simply `` The Republic of Pakistan '' .",religion
5189,Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .,religion
5190,The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor .,religion
5191,The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .,religion
5192,"During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .",religion
5193,"Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .",religion
5194,And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .,religion
5195,"Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .",religion
5196,Salvation reconsidered .,religion
5197,My father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .,religion
5198,That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .,religion
5199,"I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in Hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .",religion
5200,"Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says , `` We must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it '' .",religion
5201,Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance .,religion
5202,"The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests , Father Feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .",religion
5203,In mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered '' I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .,religion
5204,"When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .",religion
5205,"Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action .",religion
5206,"I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit '' .",religion
5207,"He is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .",religion
5208,"of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .",religion
5209,"This is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result means .",religion
5210,"It means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .",religion
5211,"Of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits '' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .",religion
5212,"Certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative '' .",religion
5213,"Naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .",religion
5214,"Especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .",religion
5215,"Presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .",religion
5216,"Nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .",religion
5217,He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .,religion
5218,"Above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .",religion
5219,"He does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explained .",religion
5220,"and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone's doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .",religion
5221,"Mr. Philip Toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .",religion
5222,If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin '' .,religion
5223,"Against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available '' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness '' .",religion
5224,"He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i.e. , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years .",religion
5225,"This would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish '' .",religion
5226,"Nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is `` a possible result , however improbable '' ; ;",religion
5227,"`` the worst , and least probable '' result ; ;",religion
5228,`` if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing '' ; ;,religion
5229,for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .,religion
5230,"If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test '' : `` Have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are '' ? ?",religion
5231,"Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ;",religion
5232,"it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .",religion
5233,"Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .",religion
5234,`` It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation '' .,religion
5235,`` I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .,religion
5236,"But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?",religion
5237,") `` Quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .",religion
5238,"`` If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' .",religion
5239,"`` If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right .",religion
5240,I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' .,religion
5241,"Even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .",religion
5242,"Let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' .",religion
5243,"Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .",religion
5244,Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday '' .,religion
5245,"But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .",religion
5246,On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .,religion
5247,"Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .",religion
5248,`` I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation '' .,religion
5249,Would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?,religion
5250,"He does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender '' .",religion
5251,"This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons .",religion
5252,"It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .",religion
5253,`` It is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .,religion
5254,"This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; ;",religion
5255,it is to stride along the steep slope downward .,religion
5256,"The only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ;",religion
5257,"and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .",religion
5258,"That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted '' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .",religion
5259,We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future .,religion
5260,"Much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .",religion
5261,For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans .,religion
5262,This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; ;,religion
5263,"How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?",religion
5264,What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?,religion
5265,"What ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?",religion
5266,"Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .",religion
5267,"Here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .",religion
5268,"For a number of years , Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .",religion
5269,"This article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .",religion
5270,Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .,religion
5271,"Within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public '' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .",religion
5272,Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .,religion
5273,"But as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .",religion
5274,"Obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role .",religion
5275,"Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction ; ;",religion
5276,A narrow professionalism,religion
5277,"How explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood '' .",religion
5278,"Though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental '' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .",religion
5279,"all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly Negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .",religion
5280,"They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals '' but agitators for some kind of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro '' .",religion
5281,"Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work .",religion
5282,"This narrow `` professionalism '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .",religion
5283,"Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc. .",religion
5284,It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ; ;,religion
5285,( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; ;,religion
5286,"and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro '' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .",religion
5287,"( 1 ) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .",religion
5288,There is some reality to this ; ;,religion
5289,"the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the American population '' .",religion
5290,But such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both NAREB and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .,religion
5291,"Also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .",religion
5292,"Like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .",religion
5293,"Realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .",religion
5294,"Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .",religion
5295,"There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc. .",religion
5296,Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .,religion
5297,"Significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California Press ) that present the commission's findings .",religion
5298,"No one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .",religion
5299,"Relevant `` facts '' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious '' neighborhoods .",religion
5300,"Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .",religion
5301,`` Against the grain of creation '',religion
5302,"On the positive side , recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position ; ;",religion
5303,"anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .",religion
5304,"Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey '' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .",religion
5305,( This has not been the case everywhere .,religion
5306,),religion
5307,"the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .",religion
5308,"Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .",religion
5309,"But as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .",religion
5310,"One of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .",religion
5311,"But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good .",religion
5312,"That community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .",religion
5313,"Racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator .",religion
5314,"Thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .",religion
5315,"( 3 ) Over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .",religion
5316,Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .,religion
5317,"As a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed '' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .",religion
5318,"If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion .",religion
5319,"Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .",religion
5320,"Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .",religion
5321,How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?,religion
5322,We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .,religion
5323,And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .,religion
5324,Atomic energy,religion
5325,"To see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .",religion
5326,You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima .,religion
5327,It was only about the size of a baseball ; ;,religion
5328,That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; ;,religion
5329,"and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .",religion
5330,Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .,religion
5331,Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .,religion
5332,water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ;,religion
5333,there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .,religion
5334,"I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .",religion
5335,And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond .,religion
5336,And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .,religion
5337,"For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days .",religion
5338,"And think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .",religion
5339,"With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .",religion
5340,Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .,religion
5341,"It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .",religion
5342,I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .,religion
5343,"One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; ;",religion
5344,"and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?",religion
5345,I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; ;,religion
5346,Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ;,religion
5347,a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ;,religion
5348,a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ;,religion
5349,and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .,religion
5350,"I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania .",religion
5351,"Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ;",religion
5352,"so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .",religion
5353,You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ;,religion
5354,"Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; ;",religion
5355,then we have sextillion peas .,religion
5356,"Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ;",religion
5357,and then we have septillion .,religion
5358,Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; ;,religion
5359,"we get 250,000 planets ; ;",religion
5360,So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .,religion
5361,"Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .",religion
5362,Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill .,religion
5363,I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .,religion
5364,"Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .",religion
5365,"And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .",religion
5366,"These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .",religion
5367,"Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .",religion
5368,"So you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .",religion
5369,"This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .",religion
5370,"Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .",religion
5371,It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; ;,religion
5372,"it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .",religion
5373,"You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .",religion
5374,"And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .",religion
5375,Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .,religion
5376,"At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .",religion
5377,Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .,religion
5378,and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .,religion
5379,"So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ;",religion
5380,"And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .",religion
5381,And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .,religion
5382,Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's .,religion
5383,"A suggestion from Louis De Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .",religion
5384,"And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .",religion
5385,"Now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .",religion
5386,These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .,religion
5387,"And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .",religion
5388,It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .,religion
5389,"Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ;",religion
5390,"and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .",religion
5391,"And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .",religion
5392,"The Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State .",religion
5393,The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ;,religion
5394,"During about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ; ;",religion
5395,"but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime .",religion
5396,"With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .",religion
5397,How far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?,religion
5398,"To what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?",religion
5399,"A complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable .",religion
5400,Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors .,religion
5401,"Although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .",religion
5402,At times we can say that it was the major factor .,religion
5403,What in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .,religion
5404,"As we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .",religion
5405,Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent .,religion
5406,"for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was Roman Catholicism , and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy .",religion
5407,At best only an approximation could be arrived at .,religion
5408,"For instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .",religion
5409,Yet this cannot be proved .,religion
5410,We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .,religion
5411,"Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .",religion
5412,"If guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .",religion
5413,"As church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .",religion
5414,But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .,religion
5415,What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .,religion
5416,We have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .,religion
5417,"We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government .",religion
5418,Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock .,religion
5419,"By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .",religion
5420,"In the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .",religion
5421,The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock .,religion
5422,"Thus `` America '' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a New England Baptist clergyman , Samuel Francis Smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in Andover Theological Seminary .",religion
5423,With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals .,religion
5424,The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith .,religion
5425,"Here was what was called the American dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it .",religion
5426,"Later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee Bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of New England Congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` America The Beautiful '' , with the words `` O beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .",religion
5427,"America , America , God mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .",religion
5428,O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .,religion
5429,"Some were clearly of Christian origin , among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty , Christian equality , and Christian fraternity the passion of the land .",religion
5430,"Here , too , must be placed Unitarianism and , less obviously from Christian inspiration , Emerson , Transcendentalism , and the idealism of Walt Whitman .",religion
5431,"We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry James the elder , all of them out of a Christian background .",religion
5432,Reform movements,religion
5433,"With such a dream arising , at least in part , from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .",religion
5434,"Significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism .",religion
5435,Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .,religion
5436,"Quakers , some from New England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .",religion
5437,"We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , the Seventh Day Adventists , Christian Science , the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , the American Home Missionary Society , the American Bible Society , and New England theology .",religion
5438,"The atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .",religion
5439,"The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the Millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians , Emerson , and the Transcendentalists .",religion
5440,"We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the Inner Mission , and the Red Cross .",religion
5441,We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .,religion
5442,A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .,religion
5443,Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .,religion
5444,Others were ephemeral .,religion
5445,Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .,religion
5446,Still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .,religion
5447,The anti-slavery movement,religion
5448,"The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the Civil War , emancipation was achieved .",religion
5449,"For example , in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .",religion
5450,"In the latter year Samuel Hopkins , from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name , asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery .",religion
5451,"As we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery .",religion
5452,Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery .,religion
5453,"After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock .",religion
5454,"The nineteenth-century immigration , whether Protestant or Roman Catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves : they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .",religion
5455,The anti-slavery movement took many forms .,religion
5456,"Benjamin Lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a Quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .",religion
5457,It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .,religion
5458,"Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition '' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights , prohibition , and justice to the Indians .",religion
5459,"Incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout Baptist , in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible .",religion
5460,A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals .,religion
5461,Theodore Dwight Weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .,religion
5462,Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers .,religion
5463,As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .,religion
5464,A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .,religion
5465,The majority then went to the infant Oberlin .,religion
5466,They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .,religion
5467,"Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton , enlisted John Quincy Adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin .",religion
5468,He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .,religion
5469,"Wendell Phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent Massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher .",religion
5470,"He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .",religion
5471,"The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , Lewis Tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .",religion
5472,Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ;,religion
5473,"they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .",religion
5474,Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .,religion
5475,But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .,religion
5476,"Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .",religion
5477,"The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .",religion
5478,"but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .",religion
5479,This is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' .,religion
5480,"The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .",religion
5481,"He regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .",religion
5482,"In this system , no man is exempt from obligations .",religion
5483,"Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .",religion
5484,"And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .",religion
5485,"The family home was , in fact , a temple ; ;",religion
5486,The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .,religion
5487,"The common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .",religion
5488,"The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .",religion
5489,Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .,religion
5490,"If the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .",religion
5491,"Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection .",religion
5492,"Living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .",religion
5493,"In China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism .",religion
5494,"The Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena .",religion
5495,"It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .",religion
5496,The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; ;,religion
5497,Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .,religion
5498,"After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes .",religion
5499,"During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader .",religion
5500,The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .,religion
5501,"In its monastic form , Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural .",religion
5502,"Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .",religion
5503,Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .,religion
5504,"If a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .",religion
5505,But let us not be mistaken about Confucian `` virtue '' ; ;,religion
5506,"To the Confucian , `` virtue '' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .",religion
5507,"Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .",religion
5508,To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate .,religion
5509,"This , in brief , was the historical background out of which Zen emerged .",religion
5510,"Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry , and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism .",religion
5511,"Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic .",religion
5512,"But in the Chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .",religion
5513,"Actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism .",religion
5514,"The Ch'an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana , but its psychology was pure early Taoist .",religion
5515,"This is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen : the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the Infinite , with the Tao -- could be effected .",religion
5516,"So , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .",religion
5517,Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .,religion
5518,One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .,religion
5519,But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it .,religion
5520,"It is simply that in Taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .",religion
5521,The truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words .,religion

5837,Property sales assistance,government
5838,The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal Government .,government
5839,SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing .,government
5840,"Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business concerns in its area .",government

5843,"Section 8-b-2 of the Small Business Act , as amended , authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business concerns .",government
5844,The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered .,government
5845,It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region .,government
5846,Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA's facilities register so that the small business concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration .,government
5847,These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants' field of operations .,government
5848,SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations .,government

5917,Requirements,government
5918,This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms .,government
5919,Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored .,government
5920,The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses .,government

5931,Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation .,government
5932,We can help in the planning process,government
5933,.,government
5934,Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; ;,government
5935,it must express the nation's own will and goal .,government
5936,"Nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing .",government
5937,"First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs .",government
5938,"Third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources .",government
5939,"This includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which programing depends ; ;",government
5940,"surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; ;",government
5941,designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; ;,government
5942,and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established .,government
5943,We must use common sense in applying conditions,government
5944,.,government
5945,"In the more primitive areas , where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited , some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available .",government
5946,"Thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs .",government
5947,"In such a case , however , we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress being made .",government
5948,"At the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program .",government
5949,D .,government
5950,Encouraging self-help,government
5951,A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help .,government
5952,There are many others .,government
5953,"It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves .",government
5954,"External aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive .",government
5955,External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help .,government
5956,"U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take .",government
5957,.,government
5958,"In establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image .",government
5959,"On the other hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist , such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them .",government
5960,2 .,government
5961,The major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources .,government
5962,"This includes not only development programing , but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment ; ;",government
5963,fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ; ;,government
5964,and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few .,government
5965,( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources .,government
5966,"This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises , with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports .",government
5967,It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed .,government
5968,( C ) tapping the energies of the entire population .,government
5969,For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country .,government
5970,( D ) honesty in government .,government
5971,"In many societies , what we regard as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly .",government
5972,"Yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism are widespread .",government
5973,"Moreover , tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest .",government
5974,Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption .,government
5975,"A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it is politically essential in the long run .",government
5976,3 .,government
5977,U.S. position on self-help,government
5978,"The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis , tailored to priority needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help .",government
5979,In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts .,government
5980,Governments are rarely monolithic .,government
5981,"But there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance .",government
5982,Encouraging a long-term approach,government
5983,1 .,government
5984,Development requires a long-term approach,government
5985,"The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries .",government
5986,This is not a short-run goal .,government
5987,"To have any success in this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion .",government
5988,Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency,government
5989,.,government
5990,How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country .,government
5991,"In several significant cases , such as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance .",government
5992,These cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance .,government
5993,.,government
5994,"Meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth .",government
5995,"In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible .",government
5996,Aid is a long-term process,government
5997,.,government
5998,"The whole program must be conceived of as an effort , stretching over a considerable number of years , to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world .",government
5999,It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba .,government
6000,It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted .,government
6001,2 .,government
6002,( A ) the need to budget a period of years .,government
6003,Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods .,government
6004,"Dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct .",government
6005,"Moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence .",government
6006,"Thus , as a development program is being launched , commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year .",government
6007,The capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs .,government
6008,( B ) the need to plan investment programs .,government
6009,"More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence .",government
6010,"Without such forward planning , investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them ; ;",government
6011,"They must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies .",government
6012,They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section .,government
6013,The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions .,government
6014,"Moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt .",government
6015,3 .,government
6016,Providing an incentive,government
6017,"If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach , the United States , as the principal supplier of external aid , must be prepared to give long-term commitments .",government
6018,"In this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones .",government
6019,"The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them .",government
6020,"If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required .",government
6021,Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments .,government
6022,"You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known .",government
6023,Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people .,government
6024,"So , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world .",government
6025,"You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean Rusk was in Europe , and Vice President Johnson was in Asia , `` Who is running the store '' ? ?",government
6026,"And he said , `` The same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn '' .",government

6030,and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks .,government
6031,The speaker pro tempore .,government
6032,Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts ? ?,government

6034,Remarks of Hon. Joseph P. Addabbo of New York,government
6035,Mr. Addabbo .,government
6036,"It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker , the Honorable Sam Rayburn .",government
6037,"I did so because I agree with so many here today , that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States .",government
6038,"For the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country .",government
6039,To honor him is to honor ourselves .,government
6040,In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments .,government
6041,Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me .,government
6042,"At that time , he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local topics , and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time .",government
6043,He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel .,government
6044,"In conclusion , he wished me well -- and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself , he asked to be remembered to my wife and children .",government
6045,In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle .,government
6046,May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come .,government
6047,Remarks of Hon. Wayne L. Hays of Ohio,government
6048,Mr. Hays .,government
6049,"It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn .",government
6050,"In this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength .",government
6051,He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history .,government
6052,It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades .,government
6053,Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country .,government
6054,"It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my State .",government
6055,"In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State .",government
6056,"And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .",government
6057,For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district .,government
6058,There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs .,government
6059,The two are as one .,government
6060,"This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn's career , up to this hour , teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government .",government
6061,"More than that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition .",government
6062,"Through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty , forthrightness and nobility .",government
6063,This means much to the American tradition .,government
6064,"It is an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics .",government
6065,"But this we know : Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor , decency , and self-respect .",government
6066,I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose .,government
6067,Remarks of Hon. Melvin Price of Illinois,government
6068,Mr. Price .,government
6069,All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn .,government
6070,Of this I am proud .,government
6071,And Sam Rayburn is a great man -- one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation .,government
6072,"I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress .",government
6073,"He had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 , the 63d Congress .",government
6074,No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn .,government
6075,He is the recognized `` father '' of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission .,government
6076,But to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's Record .,government
6077,My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today .,government
6078,Remarks of Hon. John S. Monagan of Connecticut,government
6079,Mr. Monagan .,government
6080,Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States .,government
6081,Others may speak of Speaker Rayburn's uniquely long and devoted service ; ;,government
6082,"I prefer to speak , however , of Sam Rayburn , the person , rather than Sam Rayburn , the American institution .",government
6083,"Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition .",government
6084,"No one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world , and I shall never forget his moving talks , delivered in simple yet eloquent words , upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government .",government
6085,"Above all , he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman .",government
6086,"In this role of father confessor , he has always been most characteristic and most helpful .",government
6087,"On September 16 , Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam Rayburn .",government
6088,Origin of state automobile practices .,government
6089,The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years .,government
6090,The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 .,government
6091,"The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effecting economies in vehicle operation .",government
6092,Cars were operated in 1959 for an average $.027 per mile .,government
6093,Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes .,government
6094,"Vehicle purchase , assignment and use policies .",government
6095,"The meaningful policies governing the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers .",government
6096,The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle .,government
6097,( 2 ),government
6098,The purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis .,government
6099,( 3 ),government
6100,Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy .,government
6101,The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances .,government
6102,( 5 ),government
6103,Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles .,government
6104,( 6 ),government
6105,It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes .,government
6106,( 7 ),government
6107,The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars .,government
6108,A survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices .,government
6109,"Two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval .",government
6110,"States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool .",government
6111,"Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition , allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles .",government
6112,"Nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances .",government
6113,"Of these states the average `` change-over '' point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is 13,200 miles per year .",government
6114,Mileage allowances .,government
6115,Mileage allowances for state employees are of two types : ( A ) actual mileage and ( B ) fixed monthly allowances .,government
6116,Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of $.07 per mile .,government
6117,Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis .,government
6118,Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations .,government
6119,Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of $.07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' rates .,government
6120,The average of states' rates is $.076 per mile .,government
6121,"The travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive .",government
6122,Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject .,government
6123,They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment .,government
6124,"However , they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures .",government
6125,Flat payments over $50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles .,government
6126,Travel allowances .,government
6127,"Travel allowances , including subsistence , have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states' allowances .",government
6128,With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $15 per day subsistence .,government
6129,Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control .,government
6130,Origin of state automobile practices,government
6131,general background .,government
6132,It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island .,government
6133,Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 .,government
6134,Those that are available shed little light .,government
6135,The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917 .,government
6136,It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old .,government
6137,The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s .,government
6138,At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties .,government
6139,"Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable .",government
6140,"Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly .",government
6141,And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth .,government
6142,Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees .,government
6143,This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself .,government
6144,"It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy .",government
6145,But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees .,government
6146,Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical .,government
6147,The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them .,government
6148,History and operation of the motor pool .,government
6149,"While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly .",government
6150,"Prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned .",government
6151,This responsibility included all phases of management .,government
6152,Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities .,government
6153,The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual .,government
6154,"It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation .",government
6155,"The motor pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state .",government
6156,It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation .,government
6157,"In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government .",government
6158,The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : ``,government
6159,Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made .,government
6160,The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars .,government
6161,"Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis .",government
6162,"One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11% .",government
6163,``,government
6164,"In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services .",government
6165,"The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles .",government
6166,"( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) .",government
6167,This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive .,government
6168,Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses .,government
6169,"Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies .",government
6170,"In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile .",government
6171,"They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year .",government
6172,Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random .,government
6173,One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities .,government
6174,"Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment .",government
6175,Purchasing practices .,government
6176,The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state .,government
6177,Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made .,government
6178,"Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders .",government
6179,Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public .,government
6180,"The reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay .",government
6181,Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers .,government
6182,"Vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies",government
6183,"Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles .",government
6184,The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles .,government
6185,The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration .,government
6186,The Rhode Island property tax,government
6187,There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well .,government
6188,This tax was discontinued in 1936 .,government
6189,Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years .,government
6190,At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well .,government
6191,"Thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments .",government
6192,"This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements .",government
6193,"Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level .",government
6194,"Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax .",government
6195,This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored .,government
6196,"Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value .",government
6197,"These problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states .",government
6198,Situs of property .,government
6199,Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated .,government
6200,Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year .,government
6201,"Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles .",government
6202,"Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December .",government
6203,"In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft .",government
6204,"A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield .",government
6205,"This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably .",government
6206,"Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year '' .",government
6207,"The Smithfield tax assessor , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated '' .",government
6208,"This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted .",government
6209,The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : ``,government
6210,An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State .,government
6211,A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' .,government
6212,"The Institute of Public Administration , in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 , recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job '' .",government
6213,"The resulting setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island '' .",government
6214,Practices in Rhode Island .,government
6215,"To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island .",government
6216,The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case .,government
6217,There are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town .,government
6218,These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time .,government
6219,"In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not .",government
6220,"One assessor checked boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mentioned house trailers , and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type .",government
6221,"In two cases , airplanes only were indicated .",government
6222,"It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes .",government
6223,Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats .,government
6224,"It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property .",government
6225,Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind .,government
6226,Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership .,government
6227,"Fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer .",government
6228,"Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed .",government
6229,On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now .,government
6230,Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner .,government
6231,Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides .,government
6232,Ten others made no reply .,government
6233,There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date .,government
6234,"To summarize , it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge .",government
6235,Boats as personal property,government
6236,taxing of boats .,government
6237,Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats .,government
6238,"Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting .",government
6239,"Through their professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed .",government
6240,"No satisfactory solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors .",government
6241,"It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats .",government
6242,"However , few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations .",government
6243,No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be .,government
6244,"Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law .",government
6245,"Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close .",government
6246,"The assessors' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem .",government
6247,Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960's industrial development effort .,government
6248,"Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000 ; ;",government
6249,"With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here .",government
6250,"Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls .",government
6251,"Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company .",government
6252,"Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation .",government
6253,They are conscious of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island .,government
6254,Aids to small business,government
6255,"Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention .",government
6256,"Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories .",government
6257,"A primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies .",government
6258,"During the past year , 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers .",government
6259,"In addition , the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ;",government
6260,how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ;,government
6261,details on marketing ; ;,government
6262,"information concerning patents , copyrights and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business .",government
6263,"The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad .",government
6264,This office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ;,government
6265,"locating foreign agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; ;",government
6266,"information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment .",government
6267,"During the year 1960 , this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made 73 field visits .",government
6268,Advertising program,government
6269,"To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000 , and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000 .",government
6270,"Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Eastern and Midwestern editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition ) .",government
6271,"The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers .",government
6272,"These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence .",government
6273,The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries ; ;,government
6274,Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries .,government
6275,"Among foreign countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India .",government
6276,Industrial promotion,government
6277,An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term `` Missionary calls '' by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists .,government
6278,"These consist of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas .",government
6279,"More than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , Brooklyn , Long Island City , Newark , Elizabeth , Stamford , Waterbury , New Haven , Bridgeport , Boston , Cambridge , Worcester , and Waltham .",government
6280,"Out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel .",government
6281,"We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits .",government
6282,Industrial conferences,government
6283,"During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division .",government
6284,"In June , the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel .",government
6285,Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 .,government
6286,Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event .,government
6287,"On October 8th of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School .",government
6288,A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals .,government
6289,"Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce .",government
6290,"Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company .",government
6291,"Workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Maine , and rounded out a rewarding program .",government
6292,"In connection with this conference , a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal .",government
6293,"Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division .",government
6294,More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients .,government
6295,Mailings and publications,government
6296,"Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors .",government
6297,"The Industrial Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure , `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue .",government
6298,"Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey , the new automated post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel .",government
6299,Planning division,government
6300,"Stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island .",government
6301,"The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council , which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning .",government
6302,"Two years ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island .",government
6303,"As the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program .",government
6304,These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division .,government
6305,( 1 ),government
6306,First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state .,government
6307,( 3 ),government
6308,"To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff .",government
6309,( 4 ),government
6310,The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ;,government
6311,among the operating departments of the state ; ;,government
6312,( 5 ),government
6313,"On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan .",government
6314,( 6 ),government
6315,"In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation .",government
6316,and the preparation of the state development budget .,government
6317,Long-range state planning,government
6318,The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation .,government
6319,"The long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation .",government
6320,"The work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete .",government
6321,Recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated .,government
6322,Basic mapping,government
6323,"Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state .",government
6324,"With these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started .",government
6325,Inventory,government
6326,"Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible .",government
6327,The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning .,government
6328,The rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use .,government
6329,"The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 .",government
6330,Analysis,government
6331,The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose .,government
6332,Special districts in Rhode island .,government
6333,It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island .,government
6334,"However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government .",government
6335,"There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) .",government
6336,"These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers .",government

6338,"In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 .",government
6339,Fiscal years in other states,government
6340,comparative data .,government
6341,A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report .,government
6342,Included in the findings are : 1 .,government
6343,"Forty-six states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 .",government
6344,"The other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 ) .",government
6345,2 .,government
6346,"In sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) .",government
6347,3 .,government
6348,"In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : :",government
6349,"( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina ) .",government
6350,5 .,government
6351,"One state , Alabama , closes its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30 .",government
6352,"Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 .",government
6353,7 .,government
6354,Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31 .,government
6355,All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31 .,government
6356,"The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments .",government
6357,"However , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity .",government
6358,Fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages,government
6359,advantages .,government
6360,An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently .,government
6361,2 .,government
6362,"The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn .",government
6363,It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .,government
6364,3 .,government
6365,The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures .,government
6366,"By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures .",government
6367,4 .,government
6368,"The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements .",government
6369,This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting .,government
6370,5 .,government
6371,The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes .,government
6372,"Furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy .",government
6373,6 .,government
6374,The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures .,government
6375,When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ;,government
6376,"and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases .",government
6377,"Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes .",government
6378,"It may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants .",government
6379,In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary .,government
6380,"Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most .",government
6381,This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year .,government
6382,It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year .,government
6383,"but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true .",government
6384,The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships .,government
6385,Disadvantages .,government
6386,"Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered .",government
6387,These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle .,government
6388,One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ;,government
6389,Little can be done about the changing of dates .,government
6390,This will be covered more fully later .,government
6391,"Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change .",government
6392,"Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely .",government
6393,The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .,government
6394,Two features are immediately evident .,government
6395,"First , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula .",government
6396,"Second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns .",government
6397,The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section .,government
6398,Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar .,government
6399,Plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end .,government
6400,What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them .,government
6401,An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought .,government
6402,"However , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved .",government
6403,"The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below .",government
6404,No change is required for these towns .,government
6405,"These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown .",government
6406,Adjustment of fiscal year .,government
6407,"One town and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only .",government
6408,This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year .,government
6409,Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity .,government
6410,"These cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket .",government
6411,Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars .,government
6412,The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them .,government
6413,"These three installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ) .",government
6414,Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 .,government
6415,"Their tax collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ;",government
6416,"and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ) .",government
6417,Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods .,government
6418,The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 .,government
6419,All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years .,government
6420,"Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 .",government
6421,Methods of financing adjustments,government
6422,It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements .,government
6423,In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ;,government
6424,"it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques .",government
6425,In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes .,government
6426,"Fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule .",government
6427,"As shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars .",government
6428,"In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition .",government
6429,These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ;,government
6430,"each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval .",government
6431,Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds .,government
6432,"The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period .",government
6433,"For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem .",government
6434,"As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time .",government
6435,"On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence .",government
6436,The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony ; ;,government

6439,The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the unification of our Armed Forces under the National Security Act of 1947 .,government
6440,"National defense , like the continuing search for peace with freedom and justice for all , is `` everybody's business '' .",government
6441,"Our investment in this effort , the greatest in our Nation's history , reflects our determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom .",government
6442,It is a sound investment .,government
6443,"As the President has said , `` only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed '' .",government

Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Saturday , May 20th , 1961 , as Armed Forces Day , reminding our citizens that we should rededicate ourselves to our Nation , respecting the uniforms as the guardians of our precious liberty .",government

6639,Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency,government
6640,"The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency , established in 1949 , has published , since January 1950 , The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services .",government
6641,"Its supplement , The Medical Technicians Bulletin , supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel .",government
6642,"These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from 1922 to 1949 .",government
6643,"In addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin .",government
6644,"Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service , were between $65,000 and $70,000 .",government
6645,"Additionally , on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage .",government
6646,"From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published .",government
6647,"This resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds .",government
6648,"The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds .",government
6649,"Two special issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space Medicine , the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960 .",government
6650,"The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled , `` The Medical Officer Writes '' .",government
6651,"Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue , a section called `` Technical Notes '' was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue .",government
6652,"Occasional features were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and `` Collector's Items '' .",government
6653,"In May 1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum '' , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` Case For Diagnosis '' .",government
6654,"The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces .",government
6655,The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal .,government
6656,"This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago .",government
6657,"Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride .",government
6658,"In one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved .",government
6659,This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals .,government
6660,The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter .,government
6661,This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element .,government
6662,A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .,government
6663,The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .,government
6664,"Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .",government
6665,The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .,government
6666,"The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .",government
6667,"During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .",government
6668,Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds .,government
6669,The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .,government
6670,Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra .,government
6671,"Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules .",government
6672,"The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres .",government
6673,Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; ;,government
6674,"somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and Aj .",government
6675,Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; ;,government
6676,High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; ;,government
6677,"To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started .",government
6678,"Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead .",government
6679,The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical .,government
6680,Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; ;,government
6681,"the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 Af , with an uncertainty of 0.10 Af .",government
6682,extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported .,government
6683,Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals .,government
6684,Low temperature thermometry .,government
6685,The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af .,government
6686,"The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) .",government
6687,Acoustical interferometer .,government
6688,"When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found .",government
6689,"This result is preliminary , and work is continuing .",government
6690,Resistance thermometers .,government
6691,Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium .,government
6692,Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af .,government
6693,The estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; ;,government
6694,The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af .,government
6695,Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars .,government
6696,The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point .,government
6697,A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium .,government
6698,"However , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface .",government
6699,"It has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer .",government
6700,This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer .,government
6701,In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow .,government
6702,Pressure transducer for pvt measurements .,government
6703,Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer .,government
6704,A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested .,government
6705,Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit .,government
6706,"Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury .",government
6707,Transport properties of air .,government
6708,A 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed .,government
6709,A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region .,government
6710,Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present .,government
6711,"The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density .",government
6712,International cooperative activities .,government
6713,"In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The Netherlands , United Kingdom , U.S.S.R. , United States , and West Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af .",government
6714,"As a first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory .",government
6715,Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj .,government
6716,These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory .,government
6717,"During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature , Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry .",government
6718,"The Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics , the Instrument Society of America , and the National Bureau of Standards , attracted nearly one thousand registrants , including many from abroad .",government
6719,"The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack , General Chairman , and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld , Program Chairman .",government
6720,"Dr. A. V. Astin , NBS Director , opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories .",government

6722,Atomic physics,government
6723,"In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics .",government
6724,"The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation .",government

6727,Transition probabilities .,government
6728,"Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities .",government
6729,Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation .,government
6730,A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen .,government
6731,This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements .,government
6732,A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent .,government
6733,"A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published .",government
6734,Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities .,government
6735,"These data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned , but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas .",government

6803,"Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have .",government
6804,"The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two .",government
6805,"And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service .",government
6806,But none of these has been implemented .,government
6807,"Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand .",government
6808,"Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957 .",government
6809,Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area .,government
6810,"At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads .",government
6811,"The New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central .",government
6812,"Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area .",government
6813,The New York Central notes : ``,government
6814,The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues .,government
6815,"If these services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' .",government
6816,The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City .,government
6817,"This is a $14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively .",government
6818,"A blow to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city .",government
6819,There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. & O. - B. & O. merger scheme '' --,government
6820,The Central has pointed out .,government
6821,``,government
6822,"The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here .",government
6823,Detailed studies of the plan were well underway .,government
6824,"In the light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest '' .",government
6825,The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. & O. - B. & O. merger on June 18 .,government
6826,"Obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge .",government
6827,"However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss .",government

6842,"Cuban S.S.R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base .",government
6843,"In fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment .",government
6844,"Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home .",government
6845,"Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic .",government
6846,"Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .",government
6847,But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board .,government
6848,There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week .,government
6849,"You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; ;",government
6850,"efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past .",government
6851,"Personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba .",government
6852,"We simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .",government
6853,"Obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk .",government
6854,"A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere '' .",government
6855,next for Cuba : an arms blockade ? ?,government
6856,Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas .,government
6857,How can the United States act ? ?,government
6858,Blockade is one answer offered by experts .,government
6859,Its aim : To undermine further Cuba's economy .,government
6860,Weaken Castro .,government
6861,"Another strategy -- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro .",government
6862,"Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine .",government
6863,It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro .,government
6864,It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America .,government
6865,"It would be the most severe reprisal , short of declared war , that the United States could invoke against Castro .",government
6866,"It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon .",government
6867,"As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions .",government
6868,Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? ?,government
6869,"Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .",government
6870,More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away .,government
6871,Land-based radar would help with this task .,government
6872,So would radar picket ships .,government
6873,A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces .,government
6874,Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ;,government
6875,and it must be enforced without discrimination .,government
6876,"Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk .",government
6877,"Blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily .",government
6878,They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated .,government
6879,What could a blockade accomplish ? ?,government
6880,"Plenty , say the experts .",government
6881,"It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration .",government
6882,"Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia .",government
6883,Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband .,government
6884,"At times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports .",government
6885,"From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment .",government
6886,"The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 .",government
6887,"Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job .",government
6888,Recent changes .,government
6889,"Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled .",government
6890,"To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L. 565 ) .",government
6891,"These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness .",government
6892,Financial aspects .,government
6893,"Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis .",government
6894,"Under P. L. 113 , 78th Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .",government
6895,"Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .",government
6896,"The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three-part grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ; ;",government
6897,( 2 ) extension and improvement ; ;,government
6898,The first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section .,government
6899,Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure .,government
6900,"The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program :",government
6901,method of distributing funds,government
6902,description of formula .,government
6903,"In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income .",government
6904,"The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State .",government
6905,"It stipulates , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums .",government
6906,"These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State .",government
6907,Method of computing allotments .,government
6908,The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act .,government
6909,"The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ;",government
6910,"the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii .",government

6920,"Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S. .",government
6921,( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above .,government
6922,) 5 .,government
6923,Determine the particular State's `` allotment percentage '' .,government
6924,( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 .,government
6925,In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ;,government
6926,except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more than 75% .,government
6927,"If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme .",government
6928,6 .,government
6929,Square each State's allotment percentage .,government

6943,"( Each State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000 , must be reduced by the amount of the excess .",government
6944,) 13 .,government
6945,"Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment .",government
6946,"Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000 .",government
6947,14 .,government
6948,Additional note on allotments .,government
6949,"For the States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 .",government
6950,Matching requirements,government
6951,explanation of matching formula .,government
6952,"As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula .",government
6953,"Prior to 1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds .",government
6954,"Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40% State ( or 60% Federal ) participation in total program costs .",government
6955,The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's `` Federal share '' .,government
6956,"For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share '' .",government
6957,"Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25% a year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30% , respectively .",government
6958,"The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State's `` adjusted Federal Share '' .",government
6959,The provisions for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States .,government
6960,The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates .,government
6961,Method of computing Federal shares .,government
6962,The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act .,government
6963,"The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ;",government
6964,The following steps are employed in the calculations : 1 .,government

6988,"When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position .",government
6989,) Building plans are on page 21 .,government
6990,"Solid concrete blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter .",government
6991,Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection .,government
6992,Bricks are an alternative .,government
6993,"If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks .",government

7006,The materials for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700 .,government
7007,Contractors' charges would be additional .,government
7008,The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection .,government
7009,Pre-shaped metal shelter,government
7010,Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground .,government
7011,These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .,government
7012,"They form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth , as shown in figure 10 .",government
7013,Materials for this shelter would cost about $700 .,government
7014,His charges would be added to the cost of materials .,government
7015,"This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation .",government
7016,"The National Lumber Manufacturers Association , Washington , D. C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction .",government
7017,"The Structural Clay Products Institute , Washington , D.C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction .",government
7018,Underground concrete shelter,government
7019,"An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500 , depending on the type of entrance .",government
7020,The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection .,government

7022,"Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 .",government
7023,Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction .,government
7024,"The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959 .",government

7026,Arrangement of the entrance .,government
7027,2 .,government
7028,3 .,government
7029,4 .,government
7030,The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn .,government

7034,Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance .,government
7035,A blower may be installed to increase comfort .,government
7036,A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters .,government
7037,It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person .,government
7038,"Vent pipes also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filters are not .",government
7039,As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made .,government
7040,"It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts .",government
7041,Lighting is an important consideration .,government
7042,Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb .,government
7043,"With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured .",government
7044,A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed .,government
7045,There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas .,government
7046,Other considerations .,government
7047,"-- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 .",government
7048,"Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 .",government

7051,The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first .,government
7052,Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion .,government
7053,"Therefore , civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed .",government
7054,A battery-powered radio is essential .,government
7055,"Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation .",government
7056,There is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available .,government
7057,One instrument thus would serve both purposes .,government
7058,It will tell you as soon as possible :,government
7059,How soon you may go outdoors ; ;,government
7060,How long you may stay outside .,government
7061,You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer .,government
7062,A checklist in the Appendix ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed .,government
7063,Families with children will have particular problems .,government
7064,There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated .,government
7065,Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake .,government
7066,To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy .,government
7067,Records such as diaries can be kept .,government
7068,The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio .,government
7069,There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement .,government
7070,"However , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum .",government
7071,The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied .,government
7072,"Food , medical supplies , utensils , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it .",government
7073,"After the family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge .",government
7074,Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning .,government
7075,Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem .,government
7076,A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet .,government
7077,Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully .,government
7078,A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates .,government
7079,It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning .,government
7080,"Even if the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable .",government
7081,Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature .,government
7082,"Warm clothing and bedding , of course , are essential .",government
7083,Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided .,government
7084,A flame would use up air .,government
7085,Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need .,government
7086,4 .,government
7087,If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter,government
7088,"Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about .",government
7089,A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation .,government
7090,On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside .,government
7091,The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house .,government
7092,A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level .,government
7093,5 .,government
7094,Shelter in apartment buildings,government
7095,"In general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space .",government
7096,"The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling .",government
7097,The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling .,government
7098,"The Federal Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people .",government
7099,The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space .,government
7100,Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management .,government
7101,A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont's share of the General Motors market .,government
7102,Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted .,government
7103,Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions .,government
7104,"The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions .",government
7105,"Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont's capacity .",government
7106,The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest .,government
7107,The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' .,government
7108,"This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors '' .",government
7109,"353 U. S. , at 606 .",government
7110,"However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including Du Pont's competitors '' , outweighed the Government's claim for relief .",government
7111,"This claim , as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , 126 F.Supp.235 , alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act .",government
7112,"The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade .",government
7113,"However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations .",government
7114,"No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce .",government
7115,"This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition .",government
7116,'',government
7117,The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion : ``,government
7118,"The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended .",government
7119,"'' 353 U. S. , at 589 .",government
7120,"Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies .",government
7121,that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ;,government
7122,that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial ; ;,government
7123,and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : ``,government
7124,The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .,government
7125,The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition .,government
7126,"'' 353 U. S. , at 607 .",government
7127,"On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief .",government
7128,The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : ``,government
7129,"The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute .",government
7130,"The District Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case .",government
7131,"International Salt Co. v. United States , 332 U. S. 392 , 400-401 '' .",government
7132,"353 U. S. , at 607-608 .",government
7133,This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court .,government
7134,2 .,government
7135,"This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957 .",government
7136,"The first pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25 , 1957 .",government
7137,"At the outset , the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court .",government
7138,"Du Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont - General Motors relationship .",government
7139,"The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont's shares of General Motors .",government
7140,"Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days .",government
7141,Counsel for Du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date .,government
7142,The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract .,government
7143,The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out .,government
7144,"The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957 .",government
7145,"The plan called for divestiture by Du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years .",government
7146,"Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty & Investment Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten-year period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright .",government
7147,"If , in the trustee's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period .",government
7148,"In addition , the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be vested in Du Pont's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; ;",government
7149,"Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors ; ;",government
7150,"Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice versa ; ;",government
7151,"and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies .",government
7152,"On motion of the Amici Curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan .",government
7153,"On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings .",government
7154,The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits .,government
7155,"In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately $2.09 per share .",government
7156,"The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate .",government
7157,"Du Pont's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 .",government
7158,"Christiana and Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders .",government
7159,"Du Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval .",government
7160,"On June 6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal .",government
7161,"It argued , inter alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; ;",government
7162,General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the mandate of this Court .,government
7163,"These plans , like Du Pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .",government
7164,"Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other .",government
7165,"It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .",government
7166,"By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .",government
7167,"One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself .",government
7168,One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .,government
7169,"The Court's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' .",government
7170,"But in any event , I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court .",government
7171,I dissent .,government
7172,"Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , was convicted of violating 12a of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces .",government
7173,"He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim .",government
7174,petitioner was not denied due process ; ;,government
7175,and his conviction is sustained .,government
7176,"Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board .",government
7177,"Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation to the appeal board .",government

7179,Pp. 64-66 .,government
7180,Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States .,government

7182,"Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , contends that he was denied due process , both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial .",government
7183,"He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment .",government
7184,The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents .,government
7185,269 F. 2d 613 .,government
7186,We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act .,government
7187,361 U. S. 899 .,government
7188,"We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States , 348 U.S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment .",government
7189,"His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses , employed at night by a sugar producer .",government
7190,"He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching .",government
7191,"On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1-a .",government
7192,"On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification .",government
7193,He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ;,government
7194,"that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form .",government
7195,Thereafter he was classified 1-o .,government
7196,"On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board .",government
7197,"In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home .",government
7198,"Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so .",government
7199,"He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U.S. 385 ( 1955 ) .",government
7200,He was again reclassified 1-a by the local board .,government
7201,"There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared .",government
7202,"In his report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service .",government
7203,"Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions .",government
7204,It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities .,government
7205,"In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 .",government
7206,"The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation .",government
7207,"Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so .",government
7208,"Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching .",government
7209,But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file .,government
7210,"He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer .",government
7211,"This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file .",government
7212,Apparently he never took the trouble to find out .,government
7213,Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board .,government
7214,"After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial .",government
7215,This he did .,government
7216,"We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' .",government
7217,"We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it .",government
7218,"As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact .",government
7219,"Estep v. United States , 327 U.S. 114 '' .",government
7220,"348 U. S. , at 412-413 .",government
7221,"At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer , Evensen , as well as his report thereon .",government
7222,He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ;,government
7223,nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose .,government
7224,"Section 6(j) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file .",government
7225,"Gonzales v. United States , supra .",government
7226,But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant .,government
7227,It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board .,government
7228,It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board .,government
7229,Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .,government
7230,Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file .,government
7231,"Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed .",government
7232,It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial .,government
7233,"In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes .",government
7234,"Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts .",government
7235,"In the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes .",government
7236,Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial .,government
7237,He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy .,government
7238,Even now no such claim is asserted .,government
7239,"He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume .",government
7240,"There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' .",government
7241,"346 U.S. , at 5-6 .",government
7242,"Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report .",government
7243,Foreign policy in its total context,government
7244,We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context .,government
7245,We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted .,government
7246,Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad .,government
7247,"That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation .",government
7248,It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense .,government
7249,"It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce .",government
7250,We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .,government
7251,Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies .,government
7252,Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy .,government
7253,I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action .,government
7254,Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer .,government
7255,"The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present .",government
7256,"If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs .",government
7257,Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control .,government
7258,There will of course be times for delay and inaction .,government
7259,"What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties .",government
7260,I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies .,government
7261,We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department .,government
7262,I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas .,government
7263,"The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank .",government
7264,"Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things .",government
7265,"While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort .",government
7266,"To cite only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ;",government
7267,"the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for .",government
7268,Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world .,government
7269,Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them .,government
7270,I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them .,government
7271,"If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas .",government
7272,"This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion .",government
7273,He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country .,government
7274,"He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .",government
7275,The problems of a policy officer,government
7276,"It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government .",government
7277,I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces .,government
7278,This means practically everybody in this room .,government
7279,"The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et cetera , ad infinitum .",government
7280,"His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ? ?",government
7281,"For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer .",government
7282,"Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered .",government
7283,"Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history .",government
7284,"He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions .",government
7285,"He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it .",government
7286,"He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing .",government
7287,He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog .,government
7288,He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted .,government
7289,He must think about which of these principles must take precedence .,government
7290,He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance .,government
7291,He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem .,government
7292,He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp .,government
7293,Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? ?,government
7294,Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? ?,government
7295,Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ? ?,government
7296,How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? ?,government
7297,"If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? ?",government
7298,"The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself .",government
7299,"Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? ?",government
7300,Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? ?,government
7301,"For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem .",government
7302,Respect for the opinions of mankind,government
7303,"What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ?",government
7304,"He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind .",government
7305,"And , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? ?",government
7306,May I add a caution on this particular point ? ?,government
7307,"In the first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem .",government
7308,"Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics '' .",government
7309,This is an important consideration .,government
7310,"If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership .",government
7311,What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership .,government
7312,We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action .,government
7313,"I doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .",government
7314,"The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control .",government
7315,"The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project .",government
7316,There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service .,government
7317,In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment .,government
7318,Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States .,government
7319,Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid .,government
7320,The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services .,government
7321,Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance .,government
7322,"They should live in modest circumstances , avoiding all conspicuous consumption .",government
7323,Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts .,government
7324,Some special health requirements might have to be met .,government
7325,"For example , it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers .",government
7326,"Perhaps existing Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized .",government
7327,"For readjustment to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served .",government
7328,7 .,government
7329,In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established ? ?,government
7330,The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people .,government
7331,"Support for it cuts across party , regional , ethnic and other lines .",government
7332,"Pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State .",government
7333,"When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous , functional unit .",government
7334,"Meanwhile , the Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance .",government
7335,In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations .,government
7336,8 .,government
7337,How and when should the Peace Corps be launched ? ?,government
7338,The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost .,government
7339,Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses .,government
7340,"If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall .",government
7341,Within a year or two several thousand might be in service .,government
7342,It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated .,government
7343,9 .,government
7344,In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects .,government
7345,"There would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects .",government
7346,10 .,government
7347,How will the Peace Corps be received abroad ? ?,government
7348,"Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country .",government
7349,A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters .,government
7350,"But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends .",government
7351,"It is important , however , that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community .",government
7352,"In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee .",government
7353,We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands .,government
7354,The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership .,government
7355,Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach .,government
7356,"If presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be immeasurably better .",government
7357,11 .,government
7358,Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year .,government
7359,"Specifically , Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses , unions , civic organizations and the public at large .",government
7360,For this must be the project of the whole American people .,government
7361,An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding .,government
7362,"Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel .",government
7363,"The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored .",government
7364,12 .,government
7365,Is it worth the cost and the risks ? ?,government
7366,It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions .,government
7367,It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country .,government
7368,It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world .,government
7369,"With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas , millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before .",government
7370,"With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness .",government
7371,"The letters home , the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world .",government
7372,I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower .,government
7373,I have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis .,government
7374,The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization .,government
7375,"In addition , by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall .",government
7376,This temporary Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department of State .,government
7377,Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program .,government
7378,Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires .,government
7379,"Our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , liberated from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty .",government
7380,"One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics , and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages , the mountains , the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations .",government
7381,"The vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge .",government
7382,"To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations .",government
7383,This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work .,government
7384,"They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice .",government
7385,There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them .,government
7386,Wildlife habitat resources,government
7387,In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing .,government
7388,Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses .,government
7389,This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 .,government
7390,The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment .,government
7391,The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1 .,government
7392,"Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources .",government
7393,2 .,government
7394,"Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values .",government
7395,3 .,government
7396,"Develop wildlife openings , food patches , and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres .",government
7397,Protection,government
7398,"They kill and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses .",government
7399,The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet .,government
7400,"If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952 .",government
7401,The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services .,government
7402,"This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations .",government
7403,"In addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease .",government
7404,This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection .,government
7405,"Intensification of present activities through ( A ) quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks ; ;",government
7406,( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ;,government
7407,The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated .,government
7408,2 .,government
7409,"Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production .",government
7410,The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed .,government
7411,3 .,government
7412,4 .,government
7413,Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses .,government
7414,Protection from fire,government
7415,"It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands , all critical watersheds , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads .",government
7416,This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection .,government
7417,An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation .,government
7418,Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 .,government
7419,"Expansion , modernization , and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards .",government
7420,"This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use .",government
7421,This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel .,government
7422,2 .,government
7423,"Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for suppression of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely .",government
7424,3 .,government
7425,Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas .,government
7426,"This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks .",government
7427,These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests .,government
7428,Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known .,government
7429,Roads and trails,government
7430,The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions .,government
7431,"This system is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of Agriculture .",government
7432,"Both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests .",government
7433,"It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests .",government
7434,"In the forest development road and trail system , there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails .",government
7435,"These roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests .",government
7436,Construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture .,government
7437,"It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads , and 80,000 miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , forage , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis .",government
7438,The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection .,government
7439,The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ),government
7440,( B ),government
7441,"the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ;",government
7442,( C ),government
7443,( D ),government
7444,"the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire , windstorm , insects , and disease ; ;",government
7445,( E ),government
7446,the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals .,government
7447,"Furthermore , roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years .",government
7448,Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve .,government
7449,The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services .,government
7450,"Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails , along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails .",government
7451,"About 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads .",government
7452,About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000 .,government
7453,Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1 .,government
7454,"Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails .",government
7455,"Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices .",government
7456,2 .,government
7457,"Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period .",government
7458,"Land adjustment , land purchase , land use",government
7459,"In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together .",government
7460,"In many others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership .",government
7461,"Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership .",government
7462,"One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land , or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land .",government
7463,Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands .,government
7464,"And some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ;",government
7465,there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed .,government
7466,Lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States .,government
7467,"The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands .",government
7468,Strategy and tactics of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history .,government
7469,"The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other .",government
7470,"Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war .",government
7471,Forces and military personnel strength .,government
7472,"-- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces .",government
7473,"The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men ; ;",government
7474,"a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men ; ;",government
7475,"a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 men ; ;",government
7476,"and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men .",government
7477,"If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces .",government
7478,"Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve .",government
7479,I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare .,government
7480,Military personnel costs .,government
7481,"-- About 30% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel .",government
7482,"These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion , an increase of $187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .",government
7483,"Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .",government
7484,"These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961 .",government
7485,"Traditionally , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel .",government
7486,"The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 .",government
7487,Operation and maintenance .,government
7488,"-- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $184 million more than in 1960 .",government
7489,The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment .,government
7490,"A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential .",government
7491,Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year .,government
7492,"Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up 11% in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15% .",government
7493,"In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) .",government
7494,This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives .,government
7495,"As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .",government
7496,"Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .",government
7497,"Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal Aviation Agency .",government

7500,"Procurement , research , and construction .",government
7501,"-- Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs .",government
7502,"In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion , compared to $19.3 billion in 1960 .",government
7503,"The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices .",government
7504,"New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $4,753 million , which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960 .",government
7505,"On the other hand , the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960 .",government
7506,These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead .,government
7507,The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .,government
7508,"As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act .",government
7509,"The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress .",government
7510,The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history .,government
7511,"Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development .",government
7512,"Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated .",government
7513,"For example , the importance of the Regulus 2 , a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines .",government
7514,"Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960's .",government
7515,The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles .,government
7516,"Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project .",government
7517,"Meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message .",government
7518,The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans .,government
7519,"This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers .",government
7520,"Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program .",government

7522,Strategic forces .,government
7523,"The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier-based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles .",government
7524,"The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement .",government
7525,"One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long-range supersonic bomber .",government
7526,"This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier .",government
7527,"The first Atlas ICBM's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first Titan ICBM's next year .",government
7528,The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963 .,government
7529,"By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established .",government
7530,"Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful .",government
7531,By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system .,government
7532,"I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case .",government

7605,"This broad delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided .",government
7606,3 .,government
7607,"The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc. .",government
7608,"The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day .",government
7609,"Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others .",government
7610,An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable .,government
7611,4 .,government
7612,The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service .,government
7613,A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies .,government
7614,"This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere .",government
7615,"All AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ;",government
7616,"Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night .",government
7617,5 .,government
7618,"It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice versa , is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise .",government
7619,"During the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail ; ;",government
7620,"during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance .",government
7621,"However , in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions .",government
7622,"It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose .",government
7623,"Accordingly , the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations .",government
7624,"Class 2 , stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for limited-time class 2 , stations ) .",government
7625,"The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other .",government
7626,"With respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules ) giving average skywave values .",government
7627,These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data .,government
7628,"It was recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength .",government
7629,"For this reason , the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the steadier , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference .",government
7630,"As mentioned , the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations .",government
7631,"Our objectives , as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 )",government
7632,To provide some service to all listeners ; ;,government
7633,To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible ; ;,government
7634,( 3 ),government
7635,To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible .,government
7636,"Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others .",government
7637,"Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations .",government
7638,"Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B clear-channel stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective .",government
7639,"In dealing with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant ; ;",government
7640,the other objectives were subordinated to it .,government
7641,"The class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference .",government
7642,"With respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received ; ;",government
7643,"class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference .",government
7644,"But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it .",government
7645,7 .,government
7646,"With respect to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power .",government
7647,"In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible .",government
7648,8 .,government
7649,"As mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference .",government
7650,"During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it .",government
7651,"Therefore , under our longstanding allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received .",government
7652,"On the remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations .",government
7653,"In the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels .",government
7654,"Such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them .",government
7655,"Similarly , on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power .",government
7656,The history of the proceeding,government
7657,10 .,government
7658,The decision reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof .,government
7659,"Since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena .",government
7660,"In 1947 , affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference .",government

7803,and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind .,government
7804,"For example , out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ;",government
7805,"and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- , in the industrialized West , these social evils substantially do not exist .",government
7806,"The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business .",government
7807,"These were educated men , who , as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying , formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility .",government
7808,"That is , to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected .",government
7809,"Nevertheless , they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase .",government
7810,"But as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ;",government
7811,"The gulf between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the industrialized Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable .",government
7812,"And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity .",government
7813,Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ;,government
7814,and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong .,government
7815,"Sir Henry Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' .",government
7816,The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do .,government
7817,"The greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ;",government
7818,For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future .,government
7819,"But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress .",government
7820,"The eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart .",government
7821,"And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind .",government
7822,"During the year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ;",government
7823,"in 1960 , we granted 334 .",government
7824,"We do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all scholarly and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does .",government
7825,"Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' .",government
7826,"Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts .",government
7827,"We want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely futile ; ;",government

7829,"When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .",government
7830,"With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .",government
7831,"He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade .",government
7832,"At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools .",government
7833,"This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 , under the name D. Brown & Son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe .",government
7834,The years of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered .,government
7835,"In 1838 , a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years .",government
7836,"He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period .",government
7837,"But his business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire .",government
7838,"It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' .",government
7839,"The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ;",government
7840,"the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development .",government
7841,"Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time .",government
7842,"By 1853 , the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts .",government
7843,The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine .,government
7844,"That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement .",government
7845,"Throughout their careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades .",government
7846,"Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today .",government
7847,"In 1858 , the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine .",government
7848,"As the story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine .",government
7849,"Curious as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches .",government
7850,"When he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one .",government
7851,"Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture .",government
7852,"The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment .",government
7853,"The turret screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine .",government
7854,"Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders .",government
7855,"At that time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files .",government
7856,This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation .,government
7857,"The child of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine , the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world .",government
7858,"The original machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence .",government
7859,"During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics .",government
7860,"Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one sharpening .",government
7861,"As soon as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made .",government
7862,This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form .,government
7863,"Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and , as a byproduct , formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods .",government
7864,"The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown .",government
7865,"Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use .",government
7866,"So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day .",government
7867,The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine .,government
7868,"That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition .",government
7869,"This machine , like its milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world .",government
7870,"Following Mr. Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company .",government
7871,"In 1868 , however , a truce was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed .",government
7872,"Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark .",government
7873,"Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore its products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world .",government
7874,"Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 .",government
7875,Mr. Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men .,government
7876,He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company .,government
7877,In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad .,government
7878,"During his presidency , the company's physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world .",government
7879,"During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world .",government
7880,During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown .,government
7881,"It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines .",government
7882,"In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models .",government
7883,"In 1951 , Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business .",government
7884,The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts .,government
7885,"The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines .",government
7886,Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development .,government
7887,"In the Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories .",government
7888,"In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws .",government
7889,"Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960 .",government
7890,This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development .,government
7891,"In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 .",government
7892,Outlook for current year,government
7893,"Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 .",government
7894,"However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 .",government
7895,"In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years .",government
7896,"Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .",government
7897,Research and development,government
7898,"But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine .",government
7899,"On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings .",government
7900,"Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years .",government
7901,Stretch yarn machines,government
7902,In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines .,government
7903,These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics .,government

7911,Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine .,government
7912,This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year .,government
7913,This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry .,government
7914,The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder .,government
7915,The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ;,government
7916,"it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted .",government
7917,"Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality .",government
7918,Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine .,government
7919,New Unifil application,government
7920,"A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment .",government
7921,Take-up machines,government
7922,It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed .,government

7926,"We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction .",government
7927,Patterson Moos research,government
7928,Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells .,government
7929,"The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work .",government
7930,"In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account .",government
7931,We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials .,government
7932,The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States .,government
7933,"Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications .",government
7934,A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases .,government
7935,We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity .,government
7936,The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation .,government
7937,"Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations .",government
7938,"Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year .",government
7939,All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick .,government
7940,An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover .,government
7941,"The building will contain 430,000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant .",government
7942,"However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs .",government
7943,"A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force .",government
7944,"We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant .",government
7945,British subsidiary,government
7946,"During the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity .",government
7947,The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood .,government
7948,Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis .,government
7949,The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations .,government
7950,"In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .",government
7951,Financial developments,government
7952,The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction .,government
7953,"We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase .",government
7954,"These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona .",government
7955,Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank .,government
7956,We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment .,government
7957,"Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000 .",government
7958,"Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months .",government
7959,Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position .,government
7960,Employee contracts,government
7961,"In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately .",government
7962,"In addition , Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations .",government
7963,Personnel benefits,government
7964,"In addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees :",government
7965,"During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan .",government
7966,"At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2,412,616 .",government
7967,The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago .,government
7968,Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living .,government
7969,"As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years .",government
7970,Increased efficiency,government
7971,"As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility .",government
7972,Problems of shifting styles,government
7973,The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration .,government
7974,"Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly .",government
7975,"In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends .",government
7976,The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program .,government
7977,Musical activities,government
7978,the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life .,government

8064,"And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole .",government
8065,"The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle .",government
8066,"This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level .",government
8067,"In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets .",government
8068,"Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 .",government
8069,I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .,government
8070,Home entertainment sales up,government
8071,Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ;,government
8072,"set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic .",government
8073,"For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ;",government
8074,"however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million .",government
8075,"In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) .",government
8076,"Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ;",government
8077,sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units .,government
8078,Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 .,government
8079,"Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market .",government
8080,"The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods .",government
8081,"I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets .",government
8082,Military electronics to grow,government
8083,"1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959 .",government
8084,"It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance .",government
8085,"It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability .",government
8086,"While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions .",government
8087,"Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems .",government
8088,Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially .,government
8089,"Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 .",government
8090,"Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ;",government
8091,"it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20% .",government
8092,"The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 .",government
8093,"Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion .",government
8094,Industrial electronic equipment,government
8095,"Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959 .",government
8096,"The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960 .",government
8097,"In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright .",government
8098,"For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ;",government
8099,"sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1.9 billion .",government
8100,"In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year .",government
8101,"This is now a $1.0 billion business , up from $0.9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961 .",government
8102,The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry .,government
8103,"In the military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components .",government
8104,"Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types .",government
8105,"Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .",government
8106,"In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally .",government
8107,"As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ;",government
8108,on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ;,government
8109,and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's .,government
8110,"The appointment of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering , Inc. , of Stamford , Connecticut , a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls , has been announced by David B. Peck , Vice President , Special Products .",government
8111,Mr. Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff .,government

8122,"He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain .",government
8123,"The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service .",government
8124,The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems .,government
8125,"Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs .",government
8126,"Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course .",government
8127,The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship .,government
8128,"The president expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions .",government
8129,"He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration .",government
8130,How well do faculty members govern themselves ? ?,government
8131,There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government .,government
8132,They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government .,government
8133,"They , too , need to learn to delegate .",government
8134,"Although faculties insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government .",government
8135,"There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege .",government
8136,He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ;,government
8137,by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ;,government
8138,by minimizing the number of committees .,government
8139,"Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , complaints of a lack of communication persist .",government
8140,The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose .,government
8141,"A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is .",government
8142,"To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly .",government
8143,"The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take .",government
8144,"Success will require tact , sensitivity to faculty prerogatives , patience , and persistence .",government
8145,The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands .,government
8146,Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves .,government
8147,Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty .,government
8148,"They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas , but they also contribute to top-level decision making .",government
8149,The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance .,government
8150,Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration .,government
8151,"The administration at the same time , looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments .",government
8152,"One way that this can be done , other than by hiring new high-priced professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance .",government
8153,The quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty .,government
8154,Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to .,government
8155,"The academic dean should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development .",government
8156,"For the maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their chairmen , are strategic .",government
8157,They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion .,government
8158,Some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma .,government
8159,"They can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work .",government
8160,"At one university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty '' .",government
8161,"Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees , the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere .",government
8162,The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind .,government
8163,"No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria .",government
8164,"To avoid passing over quiet , unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments .",government
8165,There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly .,government
8166,"He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure , to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements .",government
8167,"On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action .",government
8168,"A true university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for .",government
8169,Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects ? ?,government
8170,"In the first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned .",government
8171,"In the second , more shops , laboratories , and staff will be required .",government
8172,"Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards .",government

8179,"To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research .",government
8180,"Some offices have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a university's instructional program .",government
8181,Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations .,government
8182,"More often , these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data .",government
8183,"No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators , budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents .",government
8184,"When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ;",government
8185,its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment .,government
8186,"He cannot , of course , examine each proposal from scratch .",government
8187,He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution .,government
8188,Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship .,government
8189,"Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of prominence .",government
8190,"Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy , at worst , and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning .",government
8191,In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches .,government

8193,Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role .,government
8194,"Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income .",government
8195,"Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives , so should non-academic officers .",government
8196,They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals .,government
8197,"Since he can neither accept nor reject them all , he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations .",government
8198,Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance .,government
8199,"By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the lengthened shadow of one man .",government
